# King Thordan

## Strength of the Ward

### Part 1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Light party spreads.</p><p>Healers are in front to allow them to dodge into the upcoming Heavy Impact early which lets them cast an additional GCD heal.</td>

    <td><p><b>2.</b> Heavy Impact boundaries.</p></td>

  </tr>
</table>

Note that players on the back row can simply run forward to naturally dodge the Heavy Impacts as long as Ser Guerrique is not on one of the three closer positions.

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Sacred Severs

Currently, the most popular way to resolve Sacred Severs is a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

There are **two** main ways to resolve the Sacred Severs- either DRK relative (or Zephirin-relative), or fixed E/W.

In both cases:
- The MT group takes Group 1 as its base position, away from the DRK.
- The ST group takes Group 2 as its base position, on the same side as the DRK.

### DRK relative

This is currently the most popular way to resolve Sacred Severs in PF.

**Advantages:**
- Only one movement.
- Healers can cast a GCD in between Sacred Severs.
- Less overall damage on the party.

**Disadvantages:**
- Two different movement timings.
- Multiple start/end points mean it's more disorienting when returning to the center to prepare for the next mechanic.

  </tr>
</table>

### Fixed E/W dodges

This was originally the preferred way to resolve Sacred Severs, but has since fallen out of favour.

**Advantages:**
- Fixed movement timings.
- Ending point is always E/W, so it's easy to get your bearings for the next mechanic.

**Disadvantages:**
- Two movements.
- Healers cannot stand to cast a GCD.
- Slightly more damage dealt to Group 1.

    <td><b>1.</b> Sort out swords, and start 0-4 notches away from the outside "shurikens" <b>in the **opposite** direction that the inside knights are facing</b>.</td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/sanctity_ew_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Your first movement will also be in the **opposite direction** that the inside knights faced.</p><p>When Dragon's Gaze goes off, move and stop 3-4 notches away from the next "shuriken".</p>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/sanctity_ew_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> When the AoE behind you goes off, turn around, and make your way back to the E/W positions.</td>

### Meteors

**N.B:** **Japanese** parties will do "center > cw > ccw" instead.
