# King Thordan

## Strength of the Ward

### Part 1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Light party spreads.</p><p>Healers are in front to allow them to dodge into the upcoming Heavy Impact early. This then lets them cast an additional GCD heal without using Swiftcast.</td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/strength_of_the_ward_1_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Heavy Impact boundaries.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/strength_of_the_ward_1_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that players on the back row can simply run forward to naturally dodge the Heavy Impacts as long as Ser Guerrique is not on one of the three closer positions.

**Tips:**
- Do not look for Thordan. Thordan appears at his position last, giving you the least amount of time to find him. Instead, look for the two (of three) knights that spawn closest to the center. These two knights will always spawn SW and SE relative to where Thordan will appear later.
- The two blue prey targets east and west should stand one north away from the party to avoid hitting the tanks with the AoE (and giving them a debuff that will kill them).

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Part 1: Sacred Severs

Currently, the most popular way to resolve Sacred Severs is a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

- The MT group takes Group 1 as its base position, away from the DRK.
- The ST group takes Group 2 as its base position, on the same side as the DRK.

If a player in a group receives the wrong numbered sword (e.g: MT receives the "2" sword), then the corresponding role in the other group (OT) swaps groups with that person.

### Part 2: Meteors

**N.B:** **Japanese** parties will do "center > cw > ccw" instead.

# Alternatives

## Sacred Severs - Fixed E/W dodges

This was originally the preferred way to resolve Sacred Severs, but has since fallen out of favour.
