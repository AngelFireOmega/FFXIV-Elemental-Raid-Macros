# Alternate Thordan

## Wrath of the Heavens

- Any player can be targeted for the two Thunderstrucks, including the two Spiral Pierces (tethers) and the Skyward Leap (blue prey mark).
- A player targeted by Thunderstruck *may* also be targeted for the divebomb, but *will not* be targeted by either Liquid Heaven or Alter Pyre.

- Of the four players that has not had an earlier mechanic (Skyward Leap, Spiral Pierces, divebomb, Thunders), **one** will be targeted by Liquid Heaven.
- Of the four players that *had* a mechanic (Skyward Leap, Spiral Pierce, divebomb), **one** will be targeted by Altar Pyre.

## Death of the Heavens

My preferred strat is an upside-down version of the "Komazou" strat, which splits the Dooms 2-2.

## P7 considerations

At this point, the group needs to consider what their P7 strat will be, as it will affect tank mitigation from this point onwards.

**If you are going to do a 1-1-6 strat:** Have the MT invuln the tankbuster after Death of the Heavens. This preserves both tank's cooldowns so both tanks enter P6 with all cooldowns ready.

**If you are going to do a 3-3-2 strat:** You will need to tank swap the Heavenly Heel after Death of the Heavens. This means that both tanks will begin P6 with one less mitigation available, but will have invulns for Cauterize.
