# Alternate Thordan

## Wrath of the Heavens

## Death of the Heavens

My preferred strat is an upside-down version of the "Komazou" strat, which splits the Dooms 2-2.

## P7 considerations

At this point, the group needs to consider what their P7 strat will be, as it will affect tank mitigation from this point onwards.

**If you are going to do a 1-1-6 strat:** Have the MT invuln the tankbuster after Death of the Heavens. This preserves both tank's cooldowns so both tanks enter P6 with all cooldowns ready.

**If you are going to do a 3-3-2 strat:** You will need to tank swap the Heavenly Heel after Death of the Heavens. This means that both tanks will begin P6 with one less mitigation available, but will have invulns for Cauterize.
