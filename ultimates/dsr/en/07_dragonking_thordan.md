# Dragonking Thordan

## Akh Morn's Edge

Depending on how many tank invulns you have available, you can choose to take certain Akh Morn's Edges 1-1-6 instead of the typical 3-3-2 party split.

In 1-1-6, the tank tower behind Thordan is taken by a single tank with invuln, while one DPS tower is taken by the other tank with all mitigations. The remaning 6 party members take the other DPS tower.

To standardize who goes where:

- **NW tower** - All non-tanks
- **NE tower** - Tank (all mitigations)
- **S tower** - Tank (invuln)
