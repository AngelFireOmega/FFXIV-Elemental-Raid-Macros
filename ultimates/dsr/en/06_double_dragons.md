# Double Dragons

## Mortal Vow

There are *four* Mortal Vow passes in this phase.

1. After Hallowed Wings #1
2. After Wroth Flames (this pass is *quick*)
3. After Hallowed Wings #2
4. After Cauterize → Touchdown

We pass "DTTMR", or in other words:

```
DPS → MT → ST → D1/D2 → D4
```
All passes happen in the center of the arena, except for the final pass after Touchdown (which is just done at the edge).

## Cauterize

One decision the party will need to make is how they're going to resolve the three Akh Morn's Edge in P7, as this affects how Cauterize is resolved.

## Tank considerations

* DRK is the only tank that doesn't *actually* need Rampart in this phase, as Dark Mind's cooldown is quick enough for it to be available for both Hallowed Wings.
* PLD is the only tank without a third cooldown, and will literally run out of cooldowns at Hallowed Wings #2. Healer targeted cooldowns (Aquaveil, Protraction, Exaltation, Taurachole) will be needed to help a PLD out.
