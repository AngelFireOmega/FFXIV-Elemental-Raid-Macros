# Double Dragons

## Cauterize

One decision the party will need to make is how they're going to resolve the three Akh Morn's Edge in P7.

I would recommend resolving Akh Morn's Edge 3-3-2, 1-1-6, 3-3-2, although bear in mind that I haven't had enough experience with this to have a strong opinion.

### 3-3-2, 1-1-6, 3-3-2

The safer approach is to only have **one** tank invuln the Cauterize, and have that tank stand in front of Hraesvelgr. The other tank mitigates Cauterize as per-normal.

**Advantages:**
- Both tanks begin P6 with all tank mitigations available.
- Significantly easier Akh Morn's Edge #2.
- You can concentrate targeted mitigations on the single tank that isn't using their invuln.
- Similarly, you can apply targeted debuffs (Addle, Feint) on Nidhogg.
- Even if the non-invuln tank mitigation is screwed up and they die to Cauterize, it's not a wipe as it is not Hraesvelgr that killed them.

**Disadvantages:**
- Tank mitigation timing is precise if the non-invuln tank is targeted for the single-target Wyrmsbreath tankbuster.
- Tanks don't have fixed (E/W) sides.

### Alternatives

### 3-3-2, 3-3-2, 3-3-2

**Advantages:**
- No tight timing on the final Wyrmbreath tankbuster.
- Fixed tank positions.

**Disadvantages:**
- P6 tank mitigations becomes tighter, as some tank cooldowns won't be available at the start.
- Akh Morn #2 becomes significantly harder.

### 3-3-2, 1-1-6, 1-1-6

**Advantages:**
- Both tanks begin P6 with all tank mitigations available.
- Akh Morn #2 and #3 both become easier (in particular, #2).
- Fixed tank positions.

**Disadvantages:**
- Akh Morn #3 usually isn't the problem, so the benefit from doing so isn't as great.
- Targeted mitigations are split between both tanks.
- Similarly, targeted debuffs are split between both bosses.
- If the tank in front of Hraesvelgr dies, it's a wipe.
