# Alternate Thordan

## Summary

If you are already familiar with the Alternate timeline Thordan phase, and just
need a quick summary:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Death of the Heavens</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>2-2 Dooms north</li><li>Anchored Dooms</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

Thordan appears in the center of the arena, facing South. Thordan starts the
phase by casting *Incarnation*, which simply revives the dragons lying around
the arena, and casting *The Dragon's Eye*, which is simply a damage up buff.

Because Thordan will not move or rotate while casting these abilities, have the
MT start South, and the party North.

Thordan will auto-attack the MT twice (remember, these are cone AoEs!), before
jumping to the center of the arena and casting the first Trio combo of the
phase, *Wrath of the Heavens*.

## Wrath of the Heavens

Thordan will auto-attack the MT once, before doing a *Heavenly Heel* → 3x
*Ascalon's Might* combo.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> A WAR can Holmgang this combo and have Holmgang back up in time for
Cauterize at the end of P6.</div>

## Death of the Heavens

My preferred strat is an upside-down version of the "Komazou" strat, which
splits the Dooms 2-2.

After Death of the Heavens, eight Meteor Circles will spawn that must be
defeated quickly.

A caster LB2 will destroy three Meteor Circles; if there are no casters alive,
a ranged LB2 will also suffice.

- After all Meteors have been destroyed, Thordan will reappear in the middle
  and start casting *Ancient Quaga*.
- This is then followed by a *Heavenly Heel* → 3x *Ascalon's Mercy* combo.
- Thordan then auto-attacks one more time before casting *Aetheric Burst* as
  the enrage.

Once Thordan's HP drops **below 3.0%**, he will stumble, yield, and beg for
mercy. **Do not kill Thordan.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Death of the Heavens]</b> Is there a pattern to how the Dooms are
  assigned?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Unfortunately not- who gets the Dooms are completely random.</p>
      <p>Here's an example where all four tank/healers get Doom.</p>
    </td>
  <td><img src="images/doth_debuffs.jpg"></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Death of the Heavens]</b> Is there a particular reason why Dooms go North
  instead of South?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is just for simplification- having the Dooms "North" (towards Ser
      Guerrique) couples the Dooms to North/South positions.</p>
      <p>That, in turn means that players can dodge based on whether they have
      Doom or not (Dooms dodge immediately, non-Dooms next), instead of adding
      a second layer of whether they're North or South.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Meteors]</b> Why caster LB2 instead of ranged LB2?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>A caster LB2 can target a Meteor and hit the two adjacent Meteors. A
      ranged LB2 will need to be properly aimed to hit three Meteors.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Thordan]</b> What happens if you kill Thordan in this phase?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>At the end of the next phase with Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr, Nidhogg's
      eyes threaten to take over Estinien again.</p>
      <p>If Thordan was spared at the end of this phase, this is where Thordan
      jumps in to take the eyes and become Dragonking Thordan.</p>
      <p>However, if you kill Thordan in this alternate timeline, Thordan isn't
      around to take the eyes and the party returns to a repeat of the Eyes
      phase except this time, Haurchefant isn't dead and the party is now
      missing Huarchefant's buff needed to damage the blue eye.</p>
