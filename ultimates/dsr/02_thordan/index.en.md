# King Thordan

## Summary

If you are already familiar with Thordan, and just need a quick summary:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Strength of the Ward</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>Crossed tethers</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Sanctity of the Ward</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>DRK-relative, role swap</li><li>Meteor-roles out, center > ccw > cw</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thordan opens with two auto-attacks. Each auto-attack is a small cleave, so Thordan should be pointed away from the party.

- Thordan will cast *Ascalon's Mercy Concealed*- this will fire a lethal cone AoE at each player. All players (except the MT) stack behind Thordan to bait these, and dodge to the side when the cast finishes.
- Thordan will then target the MT with three *Ascalon's Might* (large cleaves) before starting the first major mechanic.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> A WAR can Holmgang this first set of <em>Ascalon's Might</em> and have Holmgang back up in time.</div>

## Strength of the Ward

### Part 1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Light party spreads.</p><p>Healers are in front to allow them to dodge into the upcoming Heavy Impact early. This then lets them cast an additional GCD heal without using Swiftcast.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/strength_of_the_ward_1_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Heavy Impact boundaries.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/strength_of_the_ward_1_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that players on the back row can simply run forward to naturally dodge the Heavy Impacts as long as Ser Guerrique is not on one of the three closer positions.

As you are dodging the Heavy Impact, locate the two knights towards the center of the arena.

These knights indicate the orientation of the map for the next part of Strength of the Ward, and will always spawn "southwest" and "southeast".

![](images/strength_orientation.jpg)

Thordan will do another Ascalon's Mercy Concealed that locks on each player's position at the fourth Heavy Impact.

Dodge the Ascalon's Mercy Concealed, and orientate yourself to the new "North" as indicated by the two knights.

### Part 2

After dodging the Heavy Impact and Ascalon's Mercy Concealed, orientate yourself such that Thordan is north.

<table>

    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Using <b>Thordan as north</b>:</p><ul><li>Three (non-tanks) will be targeted with blue <em>Skyward Leap</em> markers.

  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> AoEs resolve.</p>

      <li>Each of the three blue-marked players will have a giant <em>Skyward Leap</em> AoE centered on them. Take care not to hit the tanks with these.</li>
      <li><em>The Dragon's Rage</em> resolves, which should be split between the three unmarked players and the two tanks.</li>
      <li>The two tanks will each be hit by <em>Holy Shield Bash</em>.</li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="images/strength_of_the_ward_2_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The two tanks will be stunned and hit with <em>Holy Bladedance</em>.</p><p>All other players enter their towers.</p></td>
    <td><img src="images/strength_of_the_ward_2_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Thordan will reappear in the middle of the arena and begin to cast *Ancient Quaga*.
- After the *Ancient Quaga*, Thordan will do another *Heavenly Heel* (tank swap), followed by 3x *Ascalon's Might*.

Thordan will then cast *Sanctity of the Ward*.

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Part 1: Sacred Severs

We resolve Sacred Severs with a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

- MT, H1, D1, D3 takes Group 1 as its base position, **opposite** the DRK.
- ST, H2, D2, D4 takes Group 2 as its base position, on the **same side** as the DRK.

Two random players will be assigned "1" and "2", indicated by the number of swords above their head. This forces them to join that group.

If a player in a group receives the wrong numbered sword from their group (e.g: D3 receives the "2" sword), then the **corresponding role** in the other group (D4) swaps groups with that person.

In other words:

1. If **you have a sword** above your head, **move to that group.**
2. Otherwise, if your **role-partner has your group's sword, swap groups.**

After Sanctity of the Ward, Thordan reappears North and begins casting *Ultimate End* (which does not have a visible castbar). This is very-heavy raid-wide damage that needs to be mitigated.

Thordan will flail around, doing two sets of *Broad Swings*. Each *Broad Swing* requires the party to dodge from behind Thordan to either his front-left or front-right, depending on which he cleaves first.

After both sets are complete, Thordan will cast *Aetheric Burst*, which serves as the hard enrage for this phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Strength of the Ward]</b> Why are the healers in front?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting the healers in front lets them get to the middle quickly and start casting a GCD heal (hitting both light parties) <em>before</em> having to dodge the Ascalon's Mercy Concealed and <em>without</em> using Swiftcast.</p><p>This affects AST and SCH (as opposed to WHM and SGE), as those healers do not have native access to GCD heals during movement.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Sanctity of the Ward]</b> Why is there a need for a role swap? Aren't there simpler strategies?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>We do a role swap because we want each group to have:<ol><li>One healer</li><li>Four players</li></ol>This minimises the damage each group takes, while still being able to heal in between the two Sacred Severs each group takes.</p><p>You <em>can</em> use other strats under <em>certain</em> conditions (e.g: an AST's Macrocosmos lets you do pretty much any strat you want), but this unfortunately doesn't generalise to PF.</p></td></tr>
