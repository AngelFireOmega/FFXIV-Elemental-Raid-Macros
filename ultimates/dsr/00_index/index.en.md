# Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)

Elemental's DSR PF strat can be broken down as follows:

- [**Ser Adelphel + Grinnaux**](../01_adelphel_and_grinnaux/index.en.md): HMRT
- [**King Thordan**](../02_thordan/index.en.md): DRK-relative, role adjust
- [**Nidhogg**](../03_nidhogg/index.en.md): Easthogg
- [**Eyes**](../04_eyes/index.en.md): T/H red, DPS blue
- [**Alternate Timeline Thordan**](../05_alternate_thordan/index.en.md):
  2-2 Dooms North, Anchored Dooms
- [**Double Dragons**](../06_double_dragons/index.en.md): â–³ WB1, DTTMR
  Mortal Vow, 5-1 WB2
- [**Dragonking Thordan**](../07_dragonking_thordan/index.en.md): All 3-3-2

### BiS Notes

- Dragonsong's Reprise is the current Ultimate, and is **not** outgeared yet.
  - BiS will be a mix of i600 gear, and i605 gear from Lapis Manalis.

Looking towards the future:

- Dragonsong's Reprise will not be outgeared until **i730** gear is available.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **269**.

## Things to note

- Using automarkers to mark Thunder players in Wroth of the Heavens, and
  especially Wroth Flames is considered the norm (*use at your own risk*).

# Ser Adelphel and Ser Grinnaux

Dragonsong's Reprise is the first Ultimate to showcase a "door" boss. As such,
there are two sets of markers and macros to use for this fight.

## English

```
{% include_relative macros/dsr_1.en.txt %}
```

## Markers

All markers are used to bait Hyperdimensional Slashes (black orbs).

# King Thordan

This is the macro for the bulk of the fight.

## English

```
{% include_relative macros/dsr_2.en.txt %}
```

## Markers

The "inner" markers are the more popular markers.

The intercardinal markers demarcate:

- The boundaries for the charges at the start of Strength of the Ward
- Where to stand to bait the towers in Nidhogg
- The boundary of Hot Tail in the Double Dragons phase.
