# Ultimate Predation

Ultima Weapon now shows up for the party to take down.

There are four main "blocks" in Ultima Weapon's timeline, that culminates in a
signature mechanic, the first of which is *Ultimate Predation*.

However, there are first a couple points to discuss.

---

## Ultima Aether

When the fight resumes, there will now be a new "Ultima Aether" gauge that 
serves as a timer to Ultima's enrage. When the gauge reaches 100, Ultima begins
its enrage sequence.

Ultima Aether is built:

- When Ultima Weapon performs certain actions.
- When players get hit by Aetheroplasm (green) orbs.
- **When a player dies.**

This last point is particularly noteworthy, as player deaths effectively bring
the enrage **forward** in addition to weakness.

---

## Rebuilding LB3

The party will need to rebuild an LB3 by the end of *Ultimate Suppression* in 
order to survive the second Ultima cast towards the end of the fight.

However, because the party's relative damage is much higher now compared to 
release, it's likely that the party will push *Ultimate Suppression* early.

The problem is that there now isn't enough time to rebuild LB3, **leading to an 
automatic wipe at Ultima #2.** Hence, there may be a need to intentionally
build LB, especially as the party gets more and more familiar.

LB is built if someone in the party takes lethal damage, but is saved by 
shields and mitigations.

The following methods take advantage of this by intentionally "killing" the 
party, but saving them through shields and mitigations.

### Method 1: Mitigating Ultimate Predation

This method involves layering on multiple mitigations on the party, and 
intentionally dodging *into* the cardinal positions in *Ultimate Predation* to
get hit by Ifrit's afterburn from *Crimson Cyclone*.

This damage is normally lethal, but because shields and mitigation keep the
party alive, LB gauge is built.

The afterburn hits for 26k-27k damage, so a minimum of **three pieces of
mitigation and shields** are needed to pull this off (H2 30s, a tank 90s,
and D3 party mitigation).

{% include youtube.html id="PxNwUonYP0o" %}

**Advantages:**
- This cannot be disrupted by healing the party after Ultima #1.

**Disadvantages:**
- Party mitigations will not be up during the leadup to *Ultimate
  Annihilation* (particularly Titan's *Tumults*).
- This requires coordinating party mitigations.
- If you have a SCH + DRK, the party will need to dodge to the same cardinal to   
  have everybody under *Sacred Soil*, as a DRK does not have *Dark Missionary*
  at this level.

### Method 2: Not healing after Ultima

This method involves **not** healing the party after the Tank LB3 that keeps 
the party alive after the first Ultima.

The goal is to keep the party's HP low enough that they would die to the 
opening Tank Purge at the start of Ultima Weapon, but shields and mitigations 
keep them alive.

- Keep the party's HP below 16k (how much damage Tank Purge deals).
- The lower the party's HP, the more mitigations you will need to survive.
- Try not to debuff Ultima Weapon (Feint, Addle, Reprisal) if possible. Doing 
  so **lowers** Ultima Weapon's outgoing damage, which may lead to the party 
  surviving the raw damage instead (and not build LB as a result).

{% include youtube.html id="ZSXfmoIN2No" %}

**Advantages:**
- You can dodge *Ultimate Predation*'s AoEs, and have party mitigation
  available for the sequence leading up to *Ultimate Annihilation*.

**Disadvantages:**
- A well-intentioned or inexperienced healer will naturally want to top up the
  party after Ultima #1, effectively ruining this method as we need to keep the
  party's HP low.
- While a SCH can use *Adloquium → Deployment Tactics* off a tank (keeping the
  party's HP low), a SGE cannot, and adding *Zoe* to *Eukrasian Prognosis*
  also heals the party up *more* in the process!

With that out of the way, we can begin discussing *Ultimate Predation*.

## Pre-Predation

Ultima opens with a Tank Purge (raid-wide AoE). During this time, the two tanks
should establish themselves as the top two players in hate.

In particular, the MT should be first in aggro, while the ST should be second.
There is not a lot of time to do this, so be careful that the ST doesn't 
accidentally take hate from the MT.

## Ultimate Predation

This is the first "Trio" combo of mechanics you'll see.

Remember that all the primals have been woken, so they will all do the Woken 
versions of their mechanics.

- **Garuda**: Spawns in a random quadrant, slightly offset diagonally from the 
  center.
- **Ifrit**: Spawns in a random intercardinal position.
- **Titan**: Spawns in a random cardinal, shifted slightly left or right.
- **Ultima**: Spawns in a random intercardinal position.

Because of Garuda's Wicked Wheel → Wicked Tornado combo, only the quadrant 
diagonally opposite Garuda will be safe to resolve this mechanic.

There are **two methods** to resolving Ultimate Predation, but both methods
follow the same rules:

1. Move to the quadrant diagonally opposite Garuda.
2. Be away from Titan.
3. Move away from Ultima.

### Method 1 - Cheesing Predation

This is my preferred method, and is actually the Japanese standard strat on Mana
DC and Gaia DC. However, it's not common in Elemental.

The idea here *isn't* to resolve Predation cleanly- instead, we want to **get 
the party hit by Ifrit's afterburn with mitigations**, and generate LB gauge as
a result.

This then *guarantees* that the party ends *Ultimate Suppression* with an LB3
in a consistent manner.

      Cyclone</em>. There will be runes on the outside of the arena- stand
      <em>between</em> the runes to get hit.</p>
      <p>If Ultima Weapon is next to you, stand on the side <em>away</em> from 
      Ultima.</p>
      <p>The party will need the following to survive:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Shields</li>
        <li>A tank 90s party mitigation</li>
        <li>H2 30s</li>
        <li>D3 party mitigation</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If your party has a SCH, try to dodge to the same cardinal for
      everyone to be under <em>Sacred Soil</em>, especially if you have a DRK
      (as they do not have a tank 90s at this level).</p>

    </td>
  </tr>

### Method 2 - Dodging Predation

The other way to resolve *Ultimate Predation* is to simply dodge all the
Primal's AoEs.

This was the way to resolve *Ultimate Predation* when the fight was current-
however, because *The Weapon's Refrain* has been outscaled over the years,
**you risk not having LB3 at the end of *Ultimate Suppression*, automatically 
leading to a wipe**.

Observe there are "rune" marks that line the outside the arena- **four runes
from a cardinal direction** will dodge Ifrit's and Titan's second set of 
mechanics, which just leaves Garuda and Ultima to manage:
