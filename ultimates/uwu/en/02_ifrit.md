# Ifrit

## Summary

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Infernal Nails</b></td><td>Reverse-Z</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>Beyond Limits</b></td><td>Caster</td></tr>
</table>

## Waking Ifrit

Infernal Nails can be hit by baited Violent Eruptions. When a Nail is hit by an Eruption, it gains a stack (to up two) and increases in size.

Each stack it receives does the following:

* Lowers the damage taken by about 10%.
* Increases the raid-wide damage dealt when the nail is destroyed.

**Ifrit gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" when an Infernal Nail with two stacks is destroyed.**

The following mechanics will also change when Ifrit is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crimson Cyclone</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash.</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash, <b>followed by a cross-shaped AoE 45 degrees to the dash</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flaming Crush</td>
    <td>Split damage.</td>
    <td><p>Split damage that <b>also afflicts a heavy "Accursed Flame" DoT</b> whose duration decreases as more players are hit.</p><p>This should be shared by <b>at least 6 players</b> for minimum impact.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **ST** will take hate at the start of the fight.
