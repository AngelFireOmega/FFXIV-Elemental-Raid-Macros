## Waking Titan

Titan is easily the hardest of the three Primals to wake.

After a knockback, Titan will target three random players (excluding the MT) to be trapped in a Granite Gaol.

A boulder will spawn opposite Titan and explode in an AoE. When a Granite Gaol is hit by this AoE, it will explode and leave behind a sludge puddle that slows movement and applies a DoT. This explosion will also trigger any other Granite Gaols hit.

Thus, the idea is to chain the three gaoled players between Titan and the opposite rock, resulting in a chain explosion that will put a sludge puddle in contact with Titan.

**Titan gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" for each DoT tick applied by this sludge puddle.**

The following mechanics will also change when Titan is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landslide</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs.</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs, <b>followed by a second set of five straight-line AoEs that bisect the first set</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weight of the Land</td>
    <td>Two sets of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
    <td><p>Three sets</p> of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **MT** will take hate at the start of the fight.
