# Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser

My preferred method of doing this phase is using [my Tollgate strat](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10898230/blog/4941271/).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>At a basic level, the tanks will keep both bosses stacked in the center, with some healer movement.<br><br>The DPS make up much of the movement in this phase.</td>

## Movement

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Chakrams will spawn directly opposite one another at any of the eight intercardinal directions, effectively splitting the party into two.</p><p>All players move towards the edge of the arena to dodge Chakrams and bait Hawk Blasters.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/bjcc/bjcc_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> When the Chakrams go off (Cruise Chaser casts Optical Sight at the same time), all players move back to the center. Both tanks swap sides.</p><p><ul><li><b>MT</b>: Wait for the <b>ST</b> to give you space before crossing over.</li><li><b>ST</b>: Enter the inner circle first, but yield to allow the <b>MT</b> to pass first before crossing over. Keep Brute Justice in the center of the arena.</li></ul></p></td>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Crashing Thunder]</b> Why does this deal so much damage?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Water and Thunder work differently.</p><p>While Crashing Wave works like any other stack damage (damage is lowered as more people are hit by Crashing Wave), Thunder is the opposite; damage <em>increases</em> as more people are hit by Crashing Thunder.</p><p>This is why we want the Thunder stacks to contain exactly two players.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hidden Mines]</b> Why was a mine baited on the DPS instead of the healers?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The Hidden Mines are baited by the two furthest players from Brute Justice, which should be the healers.</p><p>If a DPS ended up baiting the Hidden Mine, it is likely because:<ul><li>A DPS was outside the green sector marked in Step 7 above <em>or</em></li><li>The ST did not position Brute Justice in the center of the arena.</li></ul></p></td></tr>
