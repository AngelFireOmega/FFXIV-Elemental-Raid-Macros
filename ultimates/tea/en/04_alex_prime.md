# Alexander Prime

## Summary

If you are already familiar with Alexander Prime, and just need a quick summary:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Temporal Stasis</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>Red/green tethers west</li><li>No debuffs east</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>1st: ST invuln</li><li>2nd: MT invuln</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Inception Formation</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>Flarethrowers:<ul><li>MT south</li><li>ST middle</li></ul></li><li>Tanks + Shared Sentence left</li><li>ST baits Super Jump</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

We break down the mechanics below.

## Temporal Stasis

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>No debuff:</b> Go to the <b>east</b> boss.<ul><li><b>Tanks/Healers</b>: North</li><li><b>DPS:</b> South</li></ul><b>Red/Green tether:</b> Go to the <b>west</b> boss.<ul><li><b>Tanks/Healers:</b> North</li><li><b>DPS:</b> South</li></ul><b>Blue tether:</b><ul><li><b>Tanks/Healers:</b> West</li><li><b>DPS:</b> East</li></ul><p>The blue-tethered player on Cruise Chaser's side takes a few steps towards Cruise Chaser.</p><p><b>Aggravated Assault:</b> Far west/east on the same side as Brute Justice.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/temporal_stasis_01.jpg"><img src="../images/alex_prime/temporal_stasis_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

To summarize:

* ST invulns first Chastening Heat.
* MT baits Flarethrower south, ST baits Flarethrower mid.
* Tanks + Shared Sentence left, everyone else right.
* ST baits Super Jump far-east.
* MT invulns second Chastening Heat.

## Inception Formation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Alexander spawns either True North <em>or</em> True South.</p><ul><li><b>Green tethers:</b>: Go towards Alexander, opposite your tethered orb. <b>Criss-cross the tethers</b>.</li><li><b>Crystal AoEs:</b>: Make a square formation directly opposite Alexander.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Resolve the Crystal AoEs and the green orbs.</p><p>Note that the residual AoEs will be slightly <b>larger</b> than their telegraphed size.</p><p>The party wipes if any AoEs touch each other.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Brute Justice then casts three consecutive Flarethrowers on the three closest people.</p><ul><li><b>MT</b>: Bait a Flarethrower south</li><li><b>ST</b>: Bait a Flarethrower in the middle.</li><li><b>Everyone else</b>: Stay near the intercardinal edge, but not close to Brute Justice.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The True Heart will now move to a random spot at the edge of the Arena, where Alexander will spawn and cast Sacrament.</p><p>Players will also get various debuffs to resolve.</p><ul><li><b>Tanks:</b> Go left</li><li><b>Healers:</b> Go right</li><li><b>DPS:</b><ul><li><b>Shared Sentence:</b> Go left</li><li><b>Others:</b> Go right</li></ul></li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Brute Justice will respawn West, and Cruise Chaser will respawn in the middle of the arena.</p><ul><li><b>ST:</b> Far East.</li><li><b>H1:</b> North, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>H2:</b> South, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>DPS that had the blue tether</b>: West, near Cruise Chaser.</li><li><b>Everyone else:</b> East, between Cruise Chaser and the ST <em>(not too close to Cruise Chaser!)</em></li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Cruise Chaser will then Alpha Sword the three closest players, which should be the two healers, and the DPS that had the blue tether.</p><p>When Cruise Chaser cleaves either the north or south player, the rest of the party can run behind that player to avoid the incoming Super Jump.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> Brute Justice Super Jumps on the furthest player, which should be the ST.</p><p>The impact AoE is quite large, so it's safe for all other players to run away from the ST by the third Alpha Sword.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/inception_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Wormhole Formation

Wormhole Formation will use 09STOP's method (highlighted by the [Korean simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdo02A5GbNPA9B4HN-NOt-vnTPyv2elH/view)).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Identify Limit Cut numbers, and stack in the middle of the arena to bait Chakrams.</p><p>Identify where Brute Justice is, as this will determine who baits Super Jump and Apocalyptic Ray (and thus have stricter positioning requirements).</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Move to positions.</p><ul><li>The person diagonally opposite Brute Justice (3 or 4) should bait Super Jump in front of the red dot.</li><li>The person diagonally opposite Cruise Chaser (3 or 4) should go all the way to the edge to dodge Apocalyptic Ray.</li><li><b>1</b> and <b>2</b> use anti-knockback abilities.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3. </b>Chakrams fly. Brute Justice Super Jumps on the furthest player.</p><p>Cruise Chaser cleaves <b>1</b>.</p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Brute Justice turns to face the furthest player (<b>1</b> or <b>2</b>) and casts Apocalyptic Ray.</p><p>Cruise Chaser dashes <b>2</b>.</p><ul><li><b>3</b> and <b>4</b> use anti-knockback.</li><li><b>5</b> and <b>6</b> move inside the Void puddles.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Players <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> resolve their Void puddles, then take up positions north (where <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> were).</p><p>Cruise Chaser cleaves <b>3</b>.</p><p>Alexander starts charging Sacrament. <em>(do not panic!)</em></p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Cruise Chaser dashes <b>4</b>.</p><ul><li><b>3</b>, <b>4</b>: Move one notch north to dodge Sacrament.</li><li><b>5</b>, <b>6</b>: Use anti-knockback abilities.</li><li><b>7</b>, <b>8</b>: Move inside Void puddles.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> Cruise Chaser cleaves <b>5</b>. Sacrament resolves.</p><ul><li><b>7</b>, <b>8</b>: Resolve Void puddles.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Cruise Chaser dashes <b>6</b>.</p><ul><li><b>1</b>, <b>2</b>: Move inside Void puddles.</li><li><b>7</b>, <b>8</b>: Use anti-knockback abilities.</li></ul></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_08.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>9.</b> Cruise Chaser cleaves <b>7</b>.</td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_09.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>10.</b> Cruise Chaser dashes <b>8</b></td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_10.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>11.</b> Party stacks in the middle for Incinerating Heat (a loose stack to better see Enumeration targets helps).</td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_11.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>12.</b> Resolve Enumeration the same way as Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser.</p>
    <ul><li><b>H1</b>, <b>D3</b>: Always west Enumeration.</li><li><b>H2</b>, <b>D4</b>: Always east Enumeration.</li><li><b>D1</b>: West Enumeration unless a swap is needed.</li><li><b>D2</b>: East Enumeration unless a swap is needed.</li></ul>If either side has both Enumerations (or equivalently, no Enumerations), <b>D1</b> and <b>D2</b> swap sides.</td>
	<td><img src="../images/alex_prime/wormhole_12.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the Enumeration at the end of Wormhole Formation, Alexander Prime will respawn back in the center of the arena and cast two Mega Holies back-to-back.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mega Holy</b></td>
    <td><p>MT Reprisal, H2 30s, D4</p><p><em>If timed correctly, Reprisal and Addle will cover <b>both</b> Mega Holies</em>.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After both Mega Holies, Alexander Prime will then cast "Summon Alexander" before disappearing.

## J Waves

All three bosses will reappear, with Brute Justice landing with a J Storm.

- Cruise Chaser and Brute Justice will both tether to Alexander Prime, making Alexander Prime invulnerable.

- Cruise Chaser and Alexander Prime will begin to cast their enrages (Eternal Darkness and Divine Judgment).

- Brute Justice will continually hit the party with J Waves. Each J Wave also gives Brute Justice a damage-up stack (max 16).

To clear this phase, the party will (in order):

1. Defeat Cruise Chaser. *(Eternal Darkness will finish its cast first.)*
2. Defeat Brute Justice. *(This will allow the party to damage Alexander Prime.)*
3. Defeat Alexander Prime. *(If you have time, build gauge to prepare for the reopener at Perfect Alexander.)*

As J Waves hit progressively harder, you will need to plan party mitigations accordingly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 6 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>MT 90s, ST 90s, H1 120s, H2 120s</p><p><em>(This should be around the time Cruise Chaser dies.)</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 8 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>ST Reprisal, H2 30s, D3</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 10 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>MT Reprisal, any remaining mitigations</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When Alexander Prime is defeated, a countdown to Divine Judgment will begin. 

You will need **Tank LB3, shields, and some mitigation (H2 30s)** to survive Divine Judgment and proceed onto Perfect Alexander.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Temporal Stasis]</b> Why does the blue-tethered player on Cruise Chaser's side have to take a few steps towards Cruise Chaser?</summary>

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Temporal Stasis]</b> Why does the ST take aggro at the start of the fight instead of the MT?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This lets the ST invuln the first Chastening Heat, which:</p><p><ul><li>Allows the party to tank invuln both sets of Chastening Heats, as the MT's invuln will be back up for the second (after Inception).</li><li>Allows the ST to invuln the second Ordained Capital Punishment in Perfect Alexander, even if they are a PLD.</li></ul></p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Inception]</b> Why do we criss-cross the green orb tethers?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Criss-crossing the tethers accomplishes two things:<ul><li>It curves the green orbs around the center so the players dropping the crystals don't need to dodge them.</li><li>The orb travels a shorter distance to reach the players that are closer to the crystals, giving them more time to get away from the proximity damage.</li></ul></p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Enumeration]</b> Why don't we group both tanks with one Enumeration target, and both healers with the other Enumeration target?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Although that configuration looks simple, there are a few steps involved:<ul><li>All DPS need to identify whether they are an Enumeration target.</li><li>The two (random) Enumeration targets need to figure out their priority between themselves (one west, one east).</li><li>The two (random) non-Enumeration DPS then need to move out of the way.</li></ul></p><p>By keeping the same Enumeration strat from BJCC (where D1 and D2 swap if needed), we:<ul><li>Maintain consistency between both phases.</li><li>Fix who stays out of the Enumerations (the tanks are <em>never</em> in Enumeration).</li><li>Only two DPS need to pay attention (D1 and D2) instead of all four.</li><li>There is just a cue to swap (both Enumerations on one side), instead of following a priority system.</li></ul></p></td></tr>
