# The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate)

**DISCLAIMER** - Since Elemental PF hasn't agreed on a TEA strat since Patch 5.1, I'm going to take the liberty of piecing one together myself. This is what I would do:

- [**Living Liquid**](en/01_living_liquid.md): Modified Separations (the "JP strat")
- [**Limit Cut**](en/02_limit_cut.md): 1211 or 1256
- [**Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser**](en/03_bjcc.md): Tollgate (this is my strat that I use)
- [**Alexander Prime**](en/04_alex_prime.md): 09STOP Wormhole (Korean sim strat- this is also called "Onyxia" by NA/EU)
- [**Perfect Alexander**](en/05_perfect_alex.md)

### BiS Notes

- Any gear at or above **i595** will have their substats capped.
- Relic weapons will have their substats capped at **184**.

## English

## Markers

- `ABCD` are for orientation

**Limit Cut:**
- `1234` divides the arena for Limit Cut
	- If doing 1211, start from the first explosion on the non-marked side.
	- If doing 1256, the 1256 group goes to the side without markers. The 3478 group goes to the side with markers.
	
**Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser:**
- `A`: 1st Water
- `C`: 2nd Water
- `3`: 3rd Water

**Alexander Prime:**
- `4`: Party stack for Inception Formation (except for ST, healers, and blue-tether DPS)

**Perfect Alexander:**
- `B`: Dark Beacon (Forced March, Fate Calibration Beta)
- `1234`: Exatrine
