# Bahamut Prime

While progging Bahamut, it may be useful to learn how to cheese Seventh Umbral Era so that you begin Quickmarch Trio with an LB3 (or at least very close to it).

This will let you save runs with a healer LB3 that would otherwise result in a wipe, allowing the group to get some more practice in.

## Fellruin Trio

The two possible quotes Nael will use are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>moon</b> and <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Raven's Dive → Lunar Dynamo → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From <b>hallowed moon</b> I <b>descend</b>, a rain of <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Lunar Dynamo → Raven's Dive → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <th width="34%"></th>
  <th width="33%">From on high I descend, the moon and stars to bring!</th>
  <th>From hallowed moon I descend, a rain of stars to bring!</th>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Find Nael, and either stack or spread around Nael, depending on Nael's line.</p><p>Tanks should be nearest to the middle of the arena.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_01a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_01b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> The first mechanic from Nael's line resolves.</p><p>Tempest Wing tethers appear from Bahamut, and tether to two random players, other than the tanks.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The second mechanic from Nael's line resolves. <em>(This will always be the opposite mechanic.)</em></p><p>Tanks should have the Tempest Wing tethers at this point.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_03a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_03b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Twintania's Aetheric Profusion resolves together with Bahamut's Tempest Wing.</p><p>All players must be in a Neurolink.</p></td>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> The third mechanic from Nael's line resolves, which will always be Meteor Stream (AoEs on four random players).</p><p>Spread out around the Neurolink as shown.</p></td>

Note that Nael's lines now telegraph *three* mechanics instead of two.

## Heavensfall Trio

<table>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

## Tenstrike Trio

## Grand Octet

Bahamut must be **below 60% HP** by the time it disappears for Grand Octet, or it will gain a damage-up buff in Golden Bahamut, making it impossible to clear the fight (although you will still be able to prog the adds phase).

*(This should* really *not be a problem nowadays.)*
