# Bahamut Prime

While progging Bahamut, it may be useful to learn how to cheese Seventh Umbral Era so that you begin Quickmarch Trio with an LB3 (or at least very close to it).

This will let you save runs with a healer LB3 that would otherwise result in a wipe, allowing the group to get some more practice in.

## Quickmarch Trio

## Blackfire Trio

## Fellruin Trio

The two possible quotes Nael will use are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>moon</b> and <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Raven's Dive → Lunar Dynamo → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From <b>hallowed moon</b> I <b>descend</b>, a rain of <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Lunar Dynamo → Raven's Dive → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that Nael's lines now telegraph *three* mechanics instead of two.

## Heavensfall Trio

## Tenstrike Trio

## Grand Octet

Bahamut must be **below 60% HP** by the time it disappears for Grand Octet, or it will gain a damage-up buff in Golden Bahamut, making it impossible to clear the fight (although you will still be able to prog the adds phase).

*(This should* really *not be a problem nowadays.)*
