# Run: Dynamis

Notably, all players must *end* this phase with three stacks of Dynamis in order to clear the next phase.

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the red/green tether.
  - Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the blue tether.
  - Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will appear on two players with a blue tether.

The following is the Kinda Awk strat:

<p>The strat is still in testing, and it is <b>likely</b> to change.</p>

The following is an adaptation of the GMT Sigma strat, tweaked to better fit some of the conventions done in other phases.

Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version) can be subdivided into three sub-phases.

### Part One

  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>10.</b> Two arms will spawn, followed by an Omega-M clone.</p>
    <p><b>Use the Omega-M clone as North</b>. The two hands will always spawn south-west, and south-east.</p>

    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> Arrange each row in order:</p><ul><li><b>Left:</b> 〇 > × > △ > □ <b>:Right</b></li></ul><p><em>(All tethers should now be vertical)</em></p><p><b>Remember your group (upper/lower), and your Playstation symbol.</b></p><p>The Playstation symbols will disappear.</p></td>
