# Run: Dynamis

Notably, all players must *end* this phase with three stacks of Dynamis in order to clear the next phase.

## Solar Ray

There are four Solar Rays in this phase. These are two-hit tankbusters that also apply Magic Vulnerability, forcing either a tank swap, or invuln.

They also hit *extremely* hard (base damage is a little under *three times* a tank's max HP).

Most groups will invuln at least one of these, but which one you invuln will affect what invulns are available in P6.

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

Broadly speaking, players are split into two groups based on their tethers, with each tether group having different responsibilities.

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will also appear on two players with a blue tether.

My group's current (and my preferred) method for resolving Run: Dynamis (Delta) uses GMT's strat as a base.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> When the tethers appear, make a box with the blue tethers alongside the bosses, and the green tethers making the sides.</p><p>Each corner now has a pair consisting of one player with a red/green tether, and one player with a blue tether.</p><p><em>(In this example, the starting pairs are MT+D3, ST+H1, D1+H2, and D2+D4).</em></p><ul></ul><p><b>All players face inwards</b> <em>(everyone on the top row faces down, everyone on the bottom row faces up.)</em></p><p>This is done to make the fists tidy and easy to identify.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Blue and Yellow fists then appear above each player. 

**The goal is to pair players so one blue fist is paired with a yellow fist.**

The party needs to determine which colour tethers will adjust if there's a need to.

Between the two red/green tethers and the two blue tethers:
  - One set of tethers will have fists of the same colour (blue + blue, and yellow + yellow).
  - The other set of tethers will have one blue fist, and one yellow fist at each end.

**The tethers with the blue + yellow fists will adjust.**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>Example 1:</b> Fists appear.</p>
    <ul><li>The green tethers have different coloured fists (MT D1 have blue + yellow, and H1 D4 have blue + yellow).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, the <b>green tethers</b> will adjust if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MT+D3 and H2+D1 have a blue + yellow fist, so no swaps needed.</li>
      <li>ST+H1 and D2+D4 have two fists of the same colour, so the green tethered players (H1 and D4) will swap places.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_02a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>Example 2:</b> Fists appear.</p>
    <ul><li>The blue tethers have different coloured fists (ST D3 have blue + yellow, and H2 D2 have blue + yellow).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, the <b>blue tethers</b> will adjust if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MT+D3 and H1+ST have a blue + yellow fist, so no swaps needed.</li>
      <li>H2+D1 and D2+D4 have two fists of the same colour, so the blue tethered players (H2 and D2) will swap places.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_02b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once you have determined who adjusts, the party then splits up towards the two bosses.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>2.</b> Adjust as needed, and stack in pairs in a trapizium formation, with the narrow side at Final Omega, and the long side at Beetle Omega.</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The tethers activate. This will break the outer blue-tether.</p><p>When the fist AoEs appear move to bait the spinning hands and Beyond Defense.</p>
    <ul><li><b>Red/green tethered players:</b> Bait the two spinning hands by the bosses.</li><li><b>Blue tethered players by Beetle Omega:</b> Bait the middle two spinning hands.</li><li><b>Blue tethered players by Final Omega:</b> Break your tether, and bait Beyond Defense in the middle.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Spinning hand telegraphs and Beyond Defense resolves.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> The player with Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading points their monitors in the other direction of Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p><p>This creates a safe corridor for the three blue-tethered players that weren't hit by Beyond Defense to stack together to share Pile Pitch.</p><p>Note that the Pile Pitch stack may or may not include the player with Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading.</p><p>The player hit by Beyond Defense stands somewhere within this corridor, away from the Pile Pitch stack.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

From here, we resolve the two Hello, World debuffs. We stuck with Kinda Awk's layout, even though it doesn't *quite* fit GMT.

### Alternative Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version) - Nukemaru

My group is currently going with Nukemaru's strat to resolve the knockback towers. Personally, I feel it's simple, and more importantly, the strat is agnostic to whether the towers flip.

    <p>The remaining two cardinal players (which will be on the side with four towers) take either the mid-range, or far-range towers, depending on whether you have Mid or Remote Glitch (tethers drawn in blue).</p>

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Delta (Awk)]</b> Is there a reason why blue tethers go opposite Final Omega instead of beside it, or is this an arbitrary choice?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting the blue tethers opposite Final Omega gives them the best vantage point for Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p><p>This is important, as the blue tether players will be the ones resolving Beyond Defense → Pile Pitch together with Final Omega's (and a player's) Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Delta (GMT)]</b> Why did we switch from Awk to GMT?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>I had originally started with Kinda Awk's strat because at a first glance, it looked simple and easy to execute. In addition, PF over in Mana had started adopting Sara-chan's strat, which does the same thing in principle (except Sara-chan breaks the first blue tether <em>after</em> baiting fists, instead of before).</p><p>I also didn't fully understood GMT's strat at the time (I wasn't aware that the fists spawn in BB/YY and BY/BY combinations), and so I decided not to go with GMT when I couldn't figure out how to resolve a theoretical "worst-case" configuration that in the end, will never happen in-game.</p><p>However, when my group <em>actually</em> got to progging Delta, we kept wiping to the initial fist bait, particularly on the blue-tether side.</p><p>Common complaints were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There isn't <em>that</em> much time (one second) between when the first blue tether breaks, and when players have to stack together.</li>
    <li>The fists were generally in the way, so it was hard to see the AoEs on the ground.</li>
    <li>People were forgetting if they were the inner or outer pair after stacking together.</li>
    <li>We were taking turns wiping the party as members got blue tethers for the first time, despite reviewing what happened as a group.</li>
    <li><p>There is a distance relationship implied between the four blue-tethered players:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The outer pair must be far enough that they break immediately.</li>
        <li>The outer pair must be near enough to the inner pair to stack in time.</li>
        <li>The inner pair also needs to be short enough so that they <em>do not</em> break.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Groups have been using Beetle Omega's legs as a guide for the long blue-tether to help with this.</p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>Delta was <em>still</em> inconsistent even after 10-12 pulls, so we swapped strats. After simulating GMT, we went back and cleared Delta the second time we saw it, and we have never wiped to Unmitigated Rocket Punch since.</p>
  <p>The main benefits of GMT are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It shares one advantage Awk has over Sara-chan by breaking the first blue tether immediately.</li>
    <li>Fists are baited in the middle of the arena (where the eye beam hits), which are <b>completely</b> out of the way.</li>
    <li>You have more time to resolve fists by orders of <b>magnitude</b>.</li>
    <li>It's harder to confuse your roles since GMT's pairs are one red/green and one blue tether- your tether points in the direction you're supposed to go to next after the fist AoEs appear.</li>
    <li>All players move together with the same cues, regardless of their tether. This is important as this far into the fight, we want to eliminate as many special cases as we can to avoid the situation where players have to take turns wiping the party to "the first time they get X".</li>
    <li>Players are reacting to one less thing (the blue tether breaking), since you start off stacked in pairs.</li>
    <li>There is <em>no</em> chance you accidentally break a green tether if the spinning fists force you to bait inwards.</li>
    <li>Resolving the green tethers for Swivel Cannon/Hello, World feels very natural since one green tether pair is <em>already</em> on Beetle Omega's safe side.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Perhaps we hadn't given Awk a fair chance before switching strats, or that the issues pointed above can be mitigated by looking at castbars, debuff timers, more practice, etc. and are non-issues <em>once familiar with the strat</em>.</p>
  <p>However, watching other groups prog and run into the same issues we had, I am convinced that GMT's strat is the better way to handle this mechanic.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Sigma]</b> There are strats that assign players to towers based on the waymarks they spread to in the first part of Sigma- why didn't we go along with one of those?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>I personally think those strats are fine, but isn't really suited for PF in the long term.</p>
  <p>The basic principle of assigning waymarks to towers is sound, but ultimately boils down to memorizing an arbitrary assignment, which is where macros come in.</p>
  <p>Inevitably, what'll happen (especially when TOP is no longer current content), either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nobody brings, or hits the macro mid-fight, leading to a wipe.</li>
    <li>Multiple people hit the macro mid-fight, leading to a wipe.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the case of Wingwan's strat (the Japanese style), <em>each</em> player needs to prepare eight macros, one for each waymark they may potentially spread to.</p>
  <p>That may sound okay now, but that's because TOP is current content.</p>
  <p>It'll be a much bigger ask once we're in Patch 7.x and later.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Hello, World (Sigma)]</b> Why the HTDH priority, and why should tanks take the Arm lasers if possible?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The goal is to avoid a scenario where tanks are the ones taking Beetle Omega's tethers during the last set of Hello, Worlds in Run: Dynamis (Omega Version).</p>
  <p>This is because if a tank ends up taking a tether, the Max HP debuff will wear off, and the tank will need to be topped up for the last set of Solar Ray tankbusters. While doable, it is rather annoying to deal with.</p>
  <p>To ensure a tank will not take a tether at the end of Omega, that player must enter Omega with just one stack of Dynamis, which means they must miss <em>either</em> the Dynamis stack from Delta, <em>or</em> the Dynamis stack from Sigma.</p>
  <p>If a tank is going to Omega-F, that implies that they <em>already</em> have a Dynamis stack from Delta, so we want them to miss getting a Dynamis stack from Sigma (baiting the Arm lasers) to guarantee they will not take the tethers at the end of Omega.</p>
  <p>While you cannot <em>guarantee</em> that a tank will <em>never</em> take the tethers (since a tank can be extremely unlucky and be assigned three Hello, World debuffs), this at least greatly reduces the chance of that happening.</p></td></tr>
