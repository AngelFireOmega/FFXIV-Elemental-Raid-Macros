# Run: Dynamis

Notably, all players must *end* this phase with three stacks of Dynamis in order to clear the next phase.

## Solar Ray

There are four Solar Rays in this phase. These are two-hit tankbusters that also apply Magic Vulnerability, forcing either a tank swap, or invuln.

They also hit *extremely* hard (base damage is a little under *three times* a tank's max HP).

Most groups will invuln at least one of these, but which one you invuln will affect what invulns are available in P6.

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version) - Kinda Awk

The following summarizes the Kinda Awk strat:

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will appear on two players with a blue tether.

## Alternative Run: Dynamis (Delta Version) - GMT

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Alternative:</b> The Kinda Awk strat isn't working so well with my group.</p><p>In particular, the initial blue tethers + fists are causing problems, so we are experimenting with GMT's strat instead.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Unlike the previous strat, there is an extra step to determine who has to adjust for fists.</p><p>Between the two red/green tethers and the two blue tethers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One set of tethers will have fists of the same colour (blue + blue, and yellow + yellow).</li>
  <li>The other set of tethers will have one blue fist, and one yellow fist at each end.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The tethers with the blue + yellow fists will adjust.</b></p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>Example 1:</b> Fists appear.</p>
    <ul><li>The blue tethers have the same coloured fists (ST D3 are both blue fists, H2 D2 are both yellow).</li>
    <li>The green tethers have different coloured fists (MT D1 have blue + yellow, and H1 D4 have blue + yellow).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, the <b>green tethers</b> will adjust if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MT+D3 and H2+D1 have a blue + yellow fist, so no swaps needed.</li>
      <li>ST+H1 and D2+D4 have two fists of the same colour, so the green tethered players (H1 and D4) will swap places.</li>

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Delta]</b> Is there a reason why blue tethers go opposite Final Omega instead of beside it, or is this an arbitrary choice?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting the blue tethers opposite Final Omega gives them the best vantage point for Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p><p>This is important, as the blue tether players will be the ones resolving Beyond Defense → Pile Pitch together with Final Omega's (and a player's) Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p></td></tr>

## Troubleshooting

<summary><b>[Solar Ray]</b> Can you mitigate both Solar Ray and Run: Dynamis?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Only healer 120s mitigations last long enough (20 seconds) to cover both Solar Ray and Run: Dynamis.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Delta]</b> The blue/yellow fists AoEs are missing and we get hit by Unmitigated Explosion- what happened?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The fist AoEs only appear <em>if and only if</em> a blue fist is correctly stacked with a yellow fist. This is done pair-wise, so players who <em>have</em> fist AoEs did it correctly.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Sigma]</b> There's strats that assigns players to towers based on the waymarks they spread to in the first part of Sigma- why didn't we go along with that strat?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>I personally think that strat is fine, but isn't really suited for PF in the long term.</p><p>The basic principle of assigning waymarks to towers is sound, but ultimately boils down to memorizing an arbitrary assignment, which is where macros come in.</p><p>Inevitably, what'll happen (especially when TOP is no longer current content), either:</p><ul><li>Nobody brings, or hits the macro mid-fight, leading to a wipe.</li><li>Multiple people hit the macro mid-fight, leading to a wipe.</li></ul>In the case of Wingwan's strat (the Japanese style), <em>each</em> player needs to prepare eight macros, one for each waymark they may potentially spread to.</p><p>That may sound okay now, but that's because TOP is current content.</p><p>It'll be a much bigger ask once we're in Patch 7.x and later.</p></td></tr>
