# Run: Dynamis

Notably, all players must *end* this phase with three stacks of Dynamis in order to clear the next phase.

## Solar Ray

There are four Solar Rays in this phase. These are two-hit tankbusters that also apply Magic Vulnerability, forcing either a tank swap, or invuln.

They also hit *extremely* hard (base damage is a little under *three times* a tank's max HP).

Most groups will invuln at least one of these, but which one you invuln will affect what invulns are available in P6.

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

The following summarizes the Kinda Awk strat:

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will appear on two players with a blue tether.

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.
