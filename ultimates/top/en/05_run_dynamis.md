# Run: Dynamis

Notably, all players must *end* this phase with three stacks of Dynamis in order to clear the next phase.

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the red/green tether.
  - Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the blue tether.
  - Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will appear on two players with a blue tether.

## Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</b></p>
<p>The strat is still in testing, and it is <b>likely</b> to change.</p>
<p>(I also highly doubt that it will <em>actually</em> be picked up by PF when PF reaches this point, but I think the payoff is worth at least trying.)</p>
</div>

The following is the [ETO strat](https://youtu.be/lYVRUeyVfDs) used to resolve towers. The strat frontloads some of the processing in exchange for making the tower assignments very simple.

The first part is rather unusual, but it means that resolving the towers can be broken down into three rules:

1. Take the tower at, or next to your position.
2. If you are between two towers, move to the tower that needs two players (these will be the most north, or the most south towers).
3. If there are no towers either at, or next to your position, take the tower directly opposite.

### Setup

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Two arms will spawn. Line up in two rows of four.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Left:</b> 〇 > × > △ > □ <b>:Right</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(All tethers should be vertical)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Six random players get marked, with each tether pair getting at least one marker.</p>
    <p>If your pair only has one marker, swap if needed to have the <b>non-marker</b> player towards the hands.</p><p><em>(In this example, H1 and D4 swapped rows.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The top row takes up their positions at the edge of the arena.</p>
    <p><em>All these positions will be between two markers.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>left-most</b> player <b>without a marker</b> goes NNW.</li>
      <li>The <b>right-most</b> player <b>without a marker</b> goes NNE.</li>
      <li>The <b>left-most</b> player <b>with a marker</b> goes WSW.</li>
      <li>The <b>right-most</b> player <b>with a marker</b> goes ESE.</li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

With the top row in position, the bottom row now takes up their positions, depending on whether the debuff is Remote, or Mid Glitch.

- The bottom row will **always** go to the opposite E/W side as their tether partner
  - i.e: if you're in the left tether pair, you will go right (and vice versa).
- The bottom row will go N/S, depending on whether the party has Mid or Remote Glitch.

### Remote Glitch

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>4a.</b> The bottom row takes up their positions <b>opposite</b> their tether partner.</p><p><em>The players at the north side (at the WNW and ENE sectors) are far enough to resolve Remote Glitch, but not so far that they steal the tethers from the arms.</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_05a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5a.</b> Lasers and Wave Cannons resolve.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_06a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6a.</b> Move into the center as Omega-F will teleport into the middle and knockback all players into their towers.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_07a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7a.</b> The tower rules are as such:</p><ol><li>Get knocked back to the <b>nearest</b> tower from you.</li><li>If there are two towers next to you, choose the tower that requires two players (these will be the two towers closest to the N/S poles).</li></ol></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_08a.jpg"><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_09a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Mid Glitch

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>4b.</b> The bottom row takes up their positions on the same north/southern half of the arena, across from their tether partner. The tethers should look criss-crossed.</p><p><em>These player will need to move in and out as needed to satisfy the Mid Glitch requirements (about two rings in from the edge)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_05b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5b.</b> Lasers and Wave Cannons resolve.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_06b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6b.</b> Move into the center as Omega-F will teleport into the middle and knockback all players into their towers.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_07b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7b.</b> The tower rules are as such:</p><ol><li>Get knocked back to the tower you came from.</li><li>If there is no tower at your position, take the tower <b>directly opposite</b>.</li></ol></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_08b.jpg"><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_sigma_09b.jpg"></td>

  <tr>

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.
