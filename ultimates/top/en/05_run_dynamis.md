- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the red/green tether.
  - Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Two pairs of players will be tethered with the blue tether.
  - Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will appear on two players with a blue tether.

<p>The strat is still in testing, and it is <b>likely</b> to change.</p>

The following is the Kinda Awk strat:
