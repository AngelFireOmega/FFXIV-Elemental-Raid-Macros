# Omega Reconfigured

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</b>
</div>

## Hello, World

Some things to note:

- Tethers and towers are mutually exclusive.
- Once the debuffs go out, which coloured tower goes with Defamation will be fixed for the entire sequence.
- Green/red tethers will always go with Defamation.
- Blue tethers will always go with the non-Defamation towers.

### Debuffs appear

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> When Omega casts Hello, World, players get their debuffs.</p><ul><li><b>Check which coloured-debuffs go with Defamations.</b></li></ul><p><em>In this example:</em></p><ul><li><em>Defamations (and thus red/green tethers) will go with blue towers.</em></li><li><em>Critical Synchronization (and blue tethers) will go with red towers.</em></li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_1_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### First iteration

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Pair up and move to your towers.</p><ul><li>Critical Overflow and red/green tethered players pair up and move to their towers <em>(blue in this example).</em></li><li>Critical Synchronization and blue tethered players pair up and move to their towers <em>(red in this example)</em></li></ul><p>Note the red/green tethered players are on the outside of their coloured towers, while the blue tethered players are between their coloured towers.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_1_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> The first set of tethers manifest.</p><p>Towers, Critical Overflow Bugs, and Critical Synchronization Bugs resolve.</p><ul><li>Critical Overflow Bugs transfer to the red/green tethered players.</li><li>Critical Synchronisations transfer to the blue tethered players.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_1_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Pass Critical Underflow and Critical Performance Bugs.</p><p>Blue-tethered players also break their tether in the process.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_1_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Red/green tethered players move together to break their tether.</p><p>Avoid the Nisi explosions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_1_5.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Second iteration

All players rotate their roles for the second iteration.

Red/green tethers are now Defamation.
Defamations are now taking towers.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Pair up and move to your towers.</p><ul><li>Critical Overflow and red/green tethered players pair up and move to their towers.</li><li>Critical Synchronization and blue tethered players pair up and move to their towers.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_2_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>7.</b> The next set of tethers manifest.</p><p>Towers, Critical Overflow Bugs, and Critical Synchronization Bugs resolve.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_2_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Pass Critical Underflow and Critical Performance Bugs.</p><p>Blue-tethered players also break their tether in the process.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_2_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>9.</b> Red/green tethered players move together to break their tether.</p><p>Avoid the Nisi explosions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_2_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Third iteration

All players rotate their roles again for the third iteration.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10.</b> Pair up and move to your towers.</p><ul><li>Critical Overflow and red/green tethered players pair up and move to their towers.</li><li>Critical Synchronization and blue tethered players pair up and move to their towers.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_3_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> The third set of tethers manifest.</p><p>Latent Defect, Towers, Critical Overflow Bugs, and Critical Synchronization Bugs resolve.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_3_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>12.</b> Pass Critical Underflow and Critical Performance Bugs.</p><p>Blue-tethered players also break their tether in the process.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_3_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>13.</b> Red/green tethered players move together to break their tether.</p><p>Avoid the Nisi explosions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_3_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Fourth iteration

All players rotate their roles again for the fourth (and final) iteration.

This time around, there are two differences:

1. Red/green tethers will **avoid** getting hit by Critical Overflow.
2. Players will **not** pass Critical Underflow and Critical Performance.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>14.</b> Pair up and move to your towers.</p><ul><li><b>Red/green tethered players will move <u>away</u> from the Critical Overflows this time.</b></li><li>Critical Synchronization and blue tethered players pair up and move to their towers.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_4_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>15.</b> The last set of tethers manifest.</p><p>Latent Defect, Towers, Critical Overflow Bugs, and Critical Synchronization Bugs resolve.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_4_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>16.</b> <b>Do not</b> pass Critical Underflow and Critical Performance Bugs.</p><p>Blue-tethered players break their tether.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_4_3.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>17.</b> Red/green tethered players move together to break their tether.</p><p>Avoid the Nisi explosions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_4_4.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>18.</b> All players have resolved their debuffs, and there are no more bugs remaining.</p><p>Importantly, all players still have the Overflow Debugger buffs so Omega's Critical Error will not apply another round of Critical Overflows on the party.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_4_5.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
