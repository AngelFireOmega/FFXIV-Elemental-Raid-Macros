# Run: Dynamis

P5 is split up into three "trios"- Delta, Sigma, and Omega. Each trio involves a series of mechanics before ending with Hello, World debuffs resolving that give players stacks of Dynamis, needed to clear the final phase.

The "big puzzle" in this phase is to resolve the Hello, Worlds such that **each player ends the phase with exactly 3 stacks of Dynamis**.

## Solar Ray

There are four Solar Rays in this phase. These are two-hit tankbusters that also apply Magic Vulnerability, forcing either a tank swap, or invuln.

They also hit *extremely* hard (base damage is a little under *three times* a tank's max HP).

Two of these will be taken with invulnerabilities, and the other two with mitigations; however, which two will depend on your party composition.

**If your party does not have a WAR:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Before Delta</b></td>
    <td>Invuln (PLD > GNB > DRK)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Before Sigma</b></td>
    <td>Invuln (GNB > DRK)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Before Omega</b></td>
    <td><p>Tank swap:</p><ul><li>MT: Rampart + healer mitigations</li><li>ST: Rampart + Sentinel/Nebula/Shadow Wall</li></ul><p><em>* Use Rampart when the Arm Lasers go off at the end of Sigma.</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td><p>Tank swap:</p><ul><li>MT: Rampart + Sentinel/Nebula/Shadow Wall</li><li>ST: Rampart + healer mitigations</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**If your party has a WAR:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Before Delta</b></td>
    <td>Hallowed Ground > Superbolide > Tank swap + Full buffs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Before Sigma</b></td>

# Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

Run: Dynamis (Delta Version) can be broken down into three parts:

1. Rocket Punch
2. Monitors
3. Hello, World

There are two strategies for Delta whose main difference is whether like-tethers, or unlike tethers stack together.

Players are split into two groups based on their tethers, with each tether group having different responsibilities.

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will also appear on two players with a blue tether.

## GMT's strat

This strat uses GMT's strat as a base, which pairs one green and one blue tether together for Rocket Punches, and is my preferred method for resolving Run: Dynamis (Delta).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> When the tethers appear, make a box with the blue tethers alongside the bosses, and the green tethers making the sides.</p><p>Each corner now has a pair consisting of one player with a red/green tether, and one player with a blue tether.</p><p><em>(In this example, the starting pairs are MT+D3, ST+H1, D1+H2, and D2+D4).</em></p><ul></ul><p><b>All players face inwards</b> <em>(everyone on the top row faces down, everyone on the bottom row faces up.)</em></p><p>This is done to make the fists tidy and easy to identify.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Blue and Yellow fists then appear above each player. 

**The goal is to pair players so one blue fist is paired with a yellow fist.**

The party needs to determine which colour tethers will adjust if there's a need to.

Between the two red/green tethers and the two blue tethers:
  - One set of tethers will have fists of the same colour (blue + blue, and yellow + yellow).
  - The other set of tethers will have one blue fist, and one yellow fist at each end.

**The tethers with the blue + yellow fists will adjust if needed.**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>Example 1:</b> Fists appear.</p>
    <ul><li>The green tethers have different coloured fists (MT D1 have blue + yellow, and H1 D4 have blue + yellow).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, the <b>green tethers</b> will adjust if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MT+D3 and H2+D1 have a blue + yellow fist, so no swaps needed.</li>
      <li>ST+H1 and D2+D4 have two fists of the same colour, so the green tethered players (H1 and D4) will swap places.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_02a.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>Example 2:</b> Fists appear.</p>
    <ul><li>The blue tethers have different coloured fists (ST D3 have blue + yellow, and H2 D2 have blue + yellow).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, the <b>blue tethers</b> will adjust if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MT+D3 and H1+ST have a blue + yellow fist, so no swaps needed.</li>
      <li>H2+D1 and D2+D4 have two fists of the same colour, so the blue tethered players (H2 and D2) will swap places.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_02b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once you have determined who adjusts, the party then splits up towards the two bosses.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>2.</b> Adjust as needed, and stack in pairs in a trapizium formation, with the narrow side at Final Omega, and the long side at Beetle Omega.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Arms appear on the outside of the arena, and telegraph which direction they will spin.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The tethers activate. This will break the outer blue-tether.</p><p>When the fist AoEs appear move to bait the spinning hands and Beyond Defense.</p>
    <ul><li><b>Red/green tethered players:</b> Bait the two spinning hands by the bosses.</li><li><b>Blue tethered players by Beetle Omega:</b> Bait the middle two spinning hands.</li><li><b>Blue tethered players by Final Omega:</b> Break your tether, and bait Beyond Defense in the middle.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> Spinning hand telegraphs and Beyond Defense resolves.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> The player with Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading points their monitors in the other direction of Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p><p>This creates a safe corridor for the three blue-tethered players that weren't hit by Beyond Defense to stack together to share Pile Pitch.</p><p>Note that the Pile Pitch stack may or may not include the player with Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading.</p><p>The player hit by Beyond Defense stands somewhere within this corridor, away from the Pile Pitch stack.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

From here, we resolve the two Hello, World debuffs. We stuck with Kinda Awk's layout, even though it doesn't *quite* fit GMT.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Solar Ray]</b> Can you mitigate both Solar Ray and Run: Dynamis?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Only healer 120s mitigations last long enough (20 seconds) to cover both Solar Ray and Run: Dynamis.</p></td></tr>

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Solar Ray]</b> If we don't have a WAR, why aren't we alternating between invulning and mitigating Solar Ray? (Alternatively, why spend Living Dead on the second Solar Ray instead of the third?) Wouldn't that be easier?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is a tradeoff to prepare for P6.</p><p>You <em>can</em> alternate between invulning and mitigating Solar Rays in P5, but doing so leads to problems later on in P6.</p><p>First, only two tanks can invuln the Solar Ray before Run: Dynamis (Omega) and have their invuln back in P6- DRK and WAR, so if your party is PLD + GNB, you're out of luck and have to invuln the first two Solar Rays.</p><p>This means we are left with DRK + (PLD/GNB), and we have to make a choice whether the Living Dead the second Solar Ray (before Sigma), or the third Solar Ray (before Omega).</p><p>If a DRK spends Living Dead on the third Solar Ray, Living Dead will only be available for the final tankbuster in P6, leading to the following base mitigation plan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>[~0:00] Cosmo Dive #1 → Rampart</li>
    <li>[~0:46] Wave Cannon #1 → Shadow Wall</li>
    <li>[~1:20] Wave Cannon #2 → Rampart</li>
    <li>[~1:54] Cosmo Dive #2 → Living Dead</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This, however, has the following problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cosmo Dive hits for around 270k base damage. In comparison, Wave Cannon hits much harder, around 353k base damage. As a result, additional resources will need to be dedicated to the DRK taking Wave Cannon with Rampart.</li>
    <li>Rampart will not be naturally off cooldown between Cosmo Dive #1 and Wave Cannon #2. The DRK will need to time the first Rampart so that it catches the Cosmo Dive at the end just so Rampart will be back up in time for Wave Cannon #2.</li>
    <li>The party is actively scrambling to coordinate party mitigation so that the party does not die to damage, yet alone give the DRK more mitigation to survive Wave Cannon #2 with Rampart. It's easier to move that fuss to P5's Solar Rays when there's less going on, and it's easier for the healers to pay more attention to the tanks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By not alternating between invulning and mitigating Solar Rays in P5, you get to do a much simpler base mitigation plan in P6 where things are more hectic:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>[~0:00] Cosmo Dive #1 → Rampart</li>
    <li>[~0:46] Wave Cannon #1 → MT invuln, ST 2m</li>
    <li>[~1:20] Wave Cannon #2 → MT 2m, ST invuln</li>
    <li>[~1:54] Cosmo Dive #2 → Rampart</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that this doesn't apply if your party has a WAR, as WAR is the <em>only</em> tank that can invuln the Solar Ray before Run: Dynamis (Omega) and have it back up for a Wave Cannon.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Delta (GMT)]</b> Why did we switch from Awk to GMT?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>I had originally started with Kinda Awk's strat because at a first glance, it looked simple and easy to execute. In addition, PF over in Mana had started adopting Sara-chan's strat, which does the same thing in principle (except Sara-chan breaks the first blue tether <em>after</em> baiting fists, instead of before).</p><p>I also didn't fully understood GMT's strat at the time (I wasn't aware that the fists spawn in BB/YY and BY/BY combinations), and so I decided not to go with GMT when I couldn't figure out how to resolve a theoretical "worst-case" configuration that in the end, will never happen in-game.</p><p>However, when my group <em>actually</em> got to progging Delta, we kept wiping to the initial fist bait, particularly on the blue-tether side.</p><p>Common complaints were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There isn't <em>that</em> much time (one second) between when the first blue tether breaks, and when players have to stack together.</li>
    <li>The fists were generally in the way, so it was hard to see the AoEs on the ground.</li>
    <li>People were forgetting if they were the inner or outer pair after stacking together.</li>
    <li>We were taking turns wiping the party as members got blue tethers for the first time, despite reviewing what happened as a group.</li>
    <li><p>There is a distance relationship implied between the four blue-tethered players:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The outer pair must be far enough that they break immediately.</li>
        <li>The outer pair must be near enough to the inner pair to stack in time.</li>
        <li>The inner pair also needs to be short enough so that they <em>do not</em> break.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Groups have been using Beetle Omega's legs as a guide for the long blue-tether to help with this.</p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>Delta was <em>still</em> inconsistent even after 10-12 pulls, so we swapped strats. After simulating GMT, we went back and cleared Delta the second time we saw it, and we have never wiped to Unmitigated Rocket Punch since.</p>
  <p>The main benefits of GMT are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It shares one advantage Awk has over Sara-chan by breaking the first blue tether immediately.</li>
    <li>Fists are baited in the middle of the arena (where the eye beam hits), which are <b>completely</b> out of the way.</li>
    <li>You have more time to resolve fists by orders of <b>magnitude</b>.</li>
    <li>It's harder to confuse your roles since GMT's pairs are one red/green and one blue tether- your tether points in the direction you're supposed to go to next after the fist AoEs appear.</li>
    <li>All players move together with the same cues, regardless of their tether. This is important as this far into the fight, we want to eliminate as many special cases as we can to avoid the situation where players have to take turns wiping the party to "the first time they get X".</li>
    <li>Players are reacting to one less thing (the blue tether breaking), since you start off stacked in pairs.</li>
    <li>There is <em>no</em> chance you accidentally break a green tether if the spinning fists force you to bait inwards.</li>
    <li>Resolving the green tethers for Swivel Cannon/Hello, World feels very natural since one green tether pair is <em>already</em> on Beetle Omega's safe side.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Perhaps we hadn't given Awk a fair chance before switching strats, or that the issues pointed above can be mitigated by looking at castbars, debuff timers, more practice, etc. and are non-issues <em>once familiar with the strat</em>.</p>
  <p>However, watching other groups prog and run into the same issues we had, I am convinced that GMT's strat is the better way to handle this mechanic.</p></td></tr>
