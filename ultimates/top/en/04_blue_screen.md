# Blue Screen

After defeating Omega in the previous phase, Omega will "reboot", resetting
its HP to 100% and begin the phase.

This phase is a short, 55-second race to bring Omega's HP below 20% before
Omega's enrage (Blue Screen) goes off.

This is where groups will typically open with a melee LB3.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Limit Break priority</b></td>
    <td>NIN > DRG > MNK > RPR > SAM</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the meantime, the party will need to deal with simple stack/spread mechanics
while dodging the expanding donut AoEs from the earlier transition phase.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> The stack deals more damage than the spread.</p>
  <p>Mitigations that last 15-seconds are best used after the spread beams in
  order to cover two stacks.</p>
</div>

## Second Wave

The following sets of Wave Cannons now come with the expanding Wave Repeater
AoE from the center.

<table>
  <tr>

      <p>The first hit from the Wave Repeater resolves in the center.</p>

      be needed.</em></p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Limit Break]</b> What determines who should melee LB3 here?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The order is determined by who loses the least from doing so. This is
      obviously affected by Dance Partner, but as a general guideline, the
      order should be:</p>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>NIN > DRG > MNK > RPR > SAM</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>NIN LBs here without any real loss- maybe a <em>Bhavacakra</em> at
        most.</li>
        <li>DRG loses a <em>Wyrmwind Thrust</em>, which can result in a lost or
        delayed <em>High Jump</em> due to phase push times.</li>
        <li>MNK loses two Opo-opo GCDs, resulting in a lost critical
        <em>Bootshine</em>, which can also lead to a lost <em>Forbidden
        Chakra</em>.</li>
        <li>RPR has very strong out-of-burst potency, but is not at risk of
        losing an <em>Enshroud</em> outside of a major misplay.</li>
        <li>SAM loses a <em>Midare Setsugekka</em> and a <em>Shoha</em>, which
        is the largest potency loss.</li>
      </ul>
