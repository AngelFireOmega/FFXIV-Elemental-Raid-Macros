## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Optimized Bladedance (tethers)]</b> Why are the healer 120s used here
  instead of Pile Pitch + Meteors? Wouldn't they also cover Cosmo Memory if
  used later?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Yes, they would, but this is building backwards from using the healer
      120s mitigations at the first Wave Cannon stack in P4 (Expedient also
      happens to be <em>particularly</em> useful there).</p>
      <p>In order for the healer 120s to be available for P4's Wave Cannon, the
      healers will need to use their 120s at the second set of Towers in P3.</p>
      <p>In order for the healer 120s to be available at the second set of
      Towers in P3, they need to be used early if we are going to accommodate
      for faster kill times. If the party will hold damage and kill P2 at the
      last minute, then the healer 120s can be used to mitigate Pile Pitch
      instead.</p>
