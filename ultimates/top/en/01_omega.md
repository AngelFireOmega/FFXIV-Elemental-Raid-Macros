## Program Loop

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</b>
</div>

To summarize:

- **Towers** are resolved in the order of the numbered debuffs (1 > 2 > 3 > 4)
- **Tethers** are resolved two steps away from the towers (3 > 4 > 1 > 2)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>There are eight possible spawn points.</p><p>Two towers will always spawn at a time, and they will always be either 90 degrees, or 180 degrees from one another.</p><p>Towers will not spawn in the same position twice in a row.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/program_loop_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

A priority to determine who takes which tower/tether might look something like this:
```
CW from NW (11 o'clock):
  MT > ST > H1 > H2 > D1 > D2 > D3 > D4
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> First set of towers/tethers</p><ul><li><b>1s:</b> Take your towers.</li><li><b>3s:</b> Take your tethers.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/program_loop_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Second set of towers/tethers</p><ul><li><b>2s:</b> Take your towers.</li><li><b>4s:</b> Take your tethers.</li></ul></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Third set of towers/tethers</p><ul><li><b>3s:</b> Take your towers.</li><li><b>1s:</b> Take your tethers.</li></ul><p>The max-HP down debuff will wear off on the number 3 players shortly after the previous set of towers.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Fourth set of towers/tethers</p><ul><li><b>4s:</b> Take your towers.</li><li><b>2s:</b> Take your tethers.</li></ul><p>The max-HP down debuff will wear off on the number 4 players shortly after the previous set of towers.

## Pantokrator

The following is an adaptation of HaruGlory's (OneAce's) Pantokrator strat.

In particular, they resolve the Condensed Wave Cannon Kyrios (group stack) at the back of the sector, and Guided Missile Kyrios (solo AoE) at the front of the sector.

### Condensed Waves and Guided Missiles

This loop repeats until all four players have resolved their Condensed Wave Cannon Kyrios and Guided Missile Kyrios debuffs.
