# Run: Dynamis (Omega Version)

Run: Dynamis (Omega Version) can be split down into the following three blocks:

1. Dodging AoEs
2. Hello, World #1 with Oversampled Wave Cannon
3. Hello, World #2 with tethers

## 1. Dodging AoEs

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Unlike Delta and Sigma, Omega-F will stay on the arena during this part of Omega.</p><p>Omega Reconfigured will spawn in the center, and a Omega-M/F pair will spawn at opposite intercardinal positions, again with a random Sword/Shield and Staff/Blade-Legs combo.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> A second Omega-M/F pair will spawn at the remaining two intercardinal positions, again with a random Sword/Shield and Staff/Blade-Legs combo.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Omega will channel a Diffuse Wave Cannon ("lights") at two opposite cardinal directions.</p><p>This must be resolved together with the first Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The Omega Reconfigured will then repeat this at the other two cardinal directions, which must be resolved together with the second Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>

Identifying the safe spots will take some practice. Nukemaru has compiled a collection of clips which may help:

## 2. First Hello, World with Monitors

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>5.</b> Omega will then present a single monitor set, to be resolved together with the first set of Hello, World debuffs.</p>
    <p>Omega's monitors will be taken by two players with two Dynamis stacks. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player(s) with with two Dynamis stacks and Second in Line <b>must</b> take Omega's monitors.</li>
      <li>Player(s) with with two Dynamis stacks and First in Line, <b>cannot</b> take Omega's monitors <em>(because they'll resolve their Hello, World instead)</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>In this example, MT ST, D1, and D2 each have two stacks of Dynamis.</em></p><ul><li><em>D2 has Second in Line, so they must take Omega's monitor.</em></li><li><em>ST has first in Line, so they cannot take Omega's monitor.</em></li><li><em>Either the MT or D1 can be the second player to take Omega's monitor.</em></li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve.</p><p>Done correctly, there should be:</p><ul><li>Two players with three Dynamis stacks.<ul><li>These players should <em>not</em> have the second set of Hello, World debuffs.</li></ul></li><li>The other six players should all have two Dynamis stacks.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Second Hello, World with tethers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>7.</b> Omega then spawns at a random cardinal position, and tethers to two players. These are the same tethers from P1.</p><ul><li><b>Players with 3 stacks:</b> Take the tethers and stand beside Omega.</li><li><p><b>Everybody else:</b> Form up opposite Omega to resolve Hello, Worlds.</p><p>The player with Hello, Near World can move away from the player with Hello, Distant World to ensure Near World doesn't jump to the Hello, Distant World player.</p></li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve.</p><p>All players should now have three Dynamis stacks each.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_08.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.
