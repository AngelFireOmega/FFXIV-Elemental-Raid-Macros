After a while, Omega-M and Omega-F will both cast Party Synergy, the first major mechanic of this phase.

Identifying the first set of safe spots will take some practice. Nukemaru has compiled a collection of clips which may help:

## Limitless Synergy

Omega-M and Omega-F will reappear in the middle of the arena.

For some reason, Omega swaps genders here, so the tank who previously had hate on Omega-M will have hate on Omega-F now. Both tanks will need to Provoke their target as the Packet Filter debuff is still on.

After three autoattacks, the two clones will cast Limitless Synergy and the Packet Filter debuffs will drop, so the party can now hit either target.

Omega-F will teleport North and begin casting Laser Shower, which acts as the hard-enrage. Omega-M will teleport to the middle of the arena and shield Omega-F, rendering her invulnerable until Omega-M is defeated.

Meanwhile, five more Omega-M/F clones outside the arena will throw various mechanics at the party to resolve.

<p>I am currently illustrating <b>Arthars'</b> Limitless Synergy strat, which baits the Sagittarius Arrow through the middle of the boss before dodging towards where the two tethers are.</p><p>This <en>may</em> be changed to <b>Kindred's</b> Limitless Synergy strat, which baits the Sagittarius Arrow outside the boss's hitbox, and dodges inside.</p>
<p>In addition, super-mitigating Optimised looks simple, so I'm going with that for the time being. <b>However</b>, looking at FFLogs, <em>none</em> of the cleared groups at the time of writing are doing this, making me wonder if there's something I'm missing.</p>
