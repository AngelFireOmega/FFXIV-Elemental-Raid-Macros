      <p><b>1.</b> Omega-M and Omega-F will spawn.</p>
      <p>The party will get two GCDs before Omega M and F cast <em>Firewall</em>,
      which applies a debuff on the four closest players. Those players will
      only be able to attack that target.</p>

<b>Tip:</b> If tanks use Rampart at the end of the previous phase (when Omega
jumps away), Rampart will cover this <em>Solar Ray</em> and be back up in time
for the tethers in <em>Limitless Synergy</em>.
</div>

After a while, Omega-M and Omega-F will both cast *Party Synergy*, the first
major mechanic of this phase.

## Party Synergy

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Line-up in your light parties from north-to-south.</p>

        <li>Each will be <em>in between</em> two markers.</li>

    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/02/party_synergy_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Omega-M/F's AoEs are determined by the weapons held by the genuine Omega-M/F
pair. Note how the markers demarcate the boundary of Omega-F's AoE.

After dodging Omega-M/F's AoEs, the party now resolves Mid/Remote Glitch.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>4.</b> Using the Eye as North, split up into your 4:4 groups.</p>
      <p>If the party's debuff is Mid Glitch, spread in the order 〇×▽□ from
      top-to-bottom.</p><p>Otherwise, if the party's debuff is Remote Glitch,
      only the <b>right-side group's 〇 and □</b> swap positions.</p>
      <p>Four Omega-M clones will also spawn along either all the cardinals, or
      all the intercardinal directions.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>5.</b> The other Omega-M/F pair will now switch genders.</p>
      <p>Omega-F will change to Omega-M (briefly flashing white) to make three
      Omega-Ms standing in a row.</p>
      <p><b>Use this new Omega-M as the new North.</b></p>
      <p>Come back to the center of the arena. As you do so, two players will 
      be marked with stack markers. If one side has both stack markers, the one
      <b>further</b> from the eye swaps with their partner in the other group.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, the left side × and □ players both have a stack
      marker. Since □ is further from the eye, the □ players swap sides.)</em></p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/02/party_synergy_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>6.</b> The (new) Omega-F will then do a knockback from the center.</p>
      <p>The party needs to get knocked back into two safe spots, based on whether the party has 
      Mid or Remote Glitch.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The left-side group will always knockback to the west.</li>
        <li>The right-side group will adjust depending on the party's debuff:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Mid Glitch:</b> Knockback south.</li>
            <li><b>Remote Glitch:</b> Knockback east.</li>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Because Omega-M and Omega-F swapped genders during *Party Synergy*, the tank
who previously had hate on Omega-M will now have hate on Omega-F, and 
vice-versa. Both tanks will need to *Provoke* their target either before 
*Party Synergy*, or immediately after as the *Packet Filter* debuff is still 
on.

After a few autoattacks, the two clones will cast *Limitless Synergy*, dropping
the *Packet Filter* debuffs, and giving the party one GCD to hit both targets
before starting *Limitless Synergy*.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> Omega-M will briefly stop auto-attacking to cast <em>Synthetic
  Shield</em> to prepare for <em>Limitless Synergy</em>.</p>
  <p>As a result, the ST (who is holding Omega-F) will take more damage during
  this interim from Omega-F's auto-attacks.</p>
  <p>This is also a good place to use <em>Addle</em>, as Omega-F's auto-attacks
  are magical, and targeted debuffs will not be used during <em>Limitless 
  Synergy</em>.</p>
</div>

## Limitless Synergy

Omega-F will teleport North and begin casting *Laser Shower*. Omega-M will 
teleport to the middle of the arena and shield Omega-F, rendering her 
invulnerable until Omega-M is defeated.

Meanwhile, five more Omega-M/F clones outside the arena will throw various
mechanics at the party to resolve.

      true south (indicated by the tip of Omega-M's targeting circle).</p>

        middle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, an Omega-F clone will cast <em>Optimised Meteor</em>,
      placing three Flare markers on three random players.</p>
      <p><b>Ignore the Flares, and stack together in the middle</b>.</p>

      player (which should not be the tank that was hit with Beyond Defense)
      together with <em>Optimised Meteor</em>.</p>
      <p>This will need to be <em>heavily</em> mitigated.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/02/limitless_synergy_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After *Pile Pitch* resolves, the eye will cast *Cosmo Memory*, another 
raid-wide. Because *Cosmo Memory* is cast by the Eye, this damage cannot be
mitigated through targeted debuffs *(Addle, Dismantle, Feint, Reprisal)*.

With no other mechanics left in the phase, the party must defeat Omega-M,
followed by Omega-F (in that order) before Omega-F's *Laser Shower* resolves as
the hard enrage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Firewall]</b> Should I apply DoTs on the other target before Firewall
  resolves?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>No. The Firewall effectively only lets you damage either Omega-M
      <em>or</em> Omega-F, but not both (even certain abilities like Reprisal
      are blocked).</p>
      <p>If you apply a DoT on the other target before Firewall resolves, it
      will technically tick, but deals 0 damage.</p>
