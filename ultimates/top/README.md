# The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</b>
</div>

### DISCLAIMER

**I will be using the Github to help communicate with my static what our strats are.**

Although we will try to follow what we see PF is doing, there may be some differences. In addition, the strats will probably be revised again after we clear.

The PF strat probably won't settle until the end of April as strategies get iterated on.

### BiS Notes

- Use your i630 BiS.

Looking towards the future:

- The Omega Protocol will not be outgeared until **i760** gear is available.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **287**.

**Note:** I am still undecided how to handle P5.
