## Hello, World

Omega begins the phase with its signature *Hello, World* mechanic.

*Hello, World* concludes with Omega casting *Critical Error*. This gives the
entire party *Critical Overflow Bugs*, which will lead to a wipe. However, this
is blocked by an *Overflow Debugger* buff, which is gained when a player
resolves *Critical Overflow*.

**Thus, the goal is to resolve all the debuffs, and get everybody the *Overflow
Debugger* buff** <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/overflow_debugger.png">
**before *Critical Error* is cast**.

Although *Hello, World* may look overwhelming at first, it is just four loops. Each loop, only **two things are relevant**:

1. What colour "Nisi" (*Critical Performance* and *Critical Underflow*) is paired 
   with *Critical Overflow* and *Critical Synchronization*.
2. What debuff you currently have in the cycle (the *Local/Remote Regression* 
   tethers, or the *Critical Overflow/Synchronization* "Nisis").

*Hello, World* is simply a cycle of debuffs to resolve. Players will be paired 
together based on their debuffs- at any one point, two players will be at each
stage in the cycle, alternating between towers and tethers.

- The pairing between *Critical Overflow Bugs/Critical Synchronization Bugs* 
  with *Critical Underflow Bugs/Critical Performance Bugs* (red/blue Nisis) is 
  randomly determined when *Hello, World* is cast. Once determined, **it will 
  not change** between tower sets.
- Similarly, players are randomly paired together based on their debuffs when 
  *Hello, World* is cast. Once assigned, **the pairs will not change** between
  tower sets.

This loop is repeated four times (all players will have their go at each
debuff). However, the final iteration has one small difference where the *Local
Regression* players stand *away* from the *Critical Overflow Bugs* instead.

### Fourth (final) iteration

All players rotate their roles again for the fourth (and final) iteration.

- Players who were Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
  become Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/remote_regression.png">
  (blue tethers)
- Players who were Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/remote_regression.png">
  become Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
- Players who were Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
  become Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/local_regression.png">
  (red/green tethers)
- Players who were Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/local_regression.png">
  become Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">.

This time around, there are two differences:

1. Red/green tethers will **join** the blue tethers at Critical
   Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
   instead of getting hit by Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
   and break **first**.
2. Players will **not** pass Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png">
   and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">.

Also note that because all players have gone through all the previous roles,
they have the *Underflow Debugger* and *Performance Debugger* buffs that 
prevent them from receiving *Critical Underflow Bug* and *Critical Performance 
Bug* again (the Nisis).

Thus, this final set of towers is **free movement**, as the Nisis will not be 
passed, even if players bump into one another.

Omega will teleport to the middle and face north.

Monitors will appear on Omega's, and on three random player's left-hand or
right-hand side. For each of the four monitors (Omega and the three players),
two random players on the monitor's side will be hit with an AoE.

The party needs to arrange themselves such that all monitors hit exactly one
player each.

PF currently resolves this using [Astoh's strat](https://twitter.com/Astoh_Shallfir/status/1619911321499361283)
(アスト式), but with a different lineup order.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Local Regression]</b> Why do the Local Regression players not stand with
  the Critical Overflows in the final iteration?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Omega casts <em>Critical Error</em> at the end of Hello, World.</p>
      <p><em>Critical Error</em> isn't just raidwide damage- <b><em>Critical 
      Error</em> also gives all players a new <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>.</b></p>
      <p>However, because all players have the <em>Critical Overflow 
      Debugger</em> buff from resolving <em>Critical Overflow</em> earlier, 
      this additional <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> will be blocked.</p>
      <p>The <em>Local Regression</em> players at the fourth set of towers
      are the players that originally started with <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>
      with the first tower, so they already have the <em>Critical Overflow
      Debugger</em> buff from then.</p>
      <p>If they stayed with the <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> players in the
      final iteration, their <em>Critical Overflow Debugger</em> buffs would 
      get consumed at the fourth towers, and as a result, they won't have the 
      <em>Critical Overflow Debugger</em> buff when Omega casts <em>Critical 
      Error</em>, and will get another round of <em>Critical Overflow Bugs</em>.</p>
      <p>These <em>Critical Overflow Bugs</em> will resolve together with 
      <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em>, making <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em> 
      impossible to resolve.</p>

  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Why are the healers north-most? Doesn't
  putting healers south-most guarantee the southern spot goes to a ranged?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Putting all four ranged players south <em>guarantees</em> that the
    southern player is a ranged, thus providing full melee uptime even in the
    scenario where all three monitor players are ranged, but the chances of
    this happening are 1/14.</p>
    <p>Putting healers at the north side means that both extremeties will have
    ranged players in the average case, which allows them to go all the way to
    the edge of the arena to give the other players more room for error, the
    north-most monitor player in particular.</p>
    <p>That being said, doing so means that a melee may have to disconnect from
    the boss in the worst case scenario, but this is an acceptable scenario
    given its likelihood.</p></td>

<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Are two of the monitor players supposed to
  be angled slightly up and down as shown in the diagram?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Astoh's original diagram had those players look exactly East/West
      horizontally, and that's still fine and a workable strat.</p>
      <p>However, the problem with going horizontally is that if you're off by
      a little bit, there's a chance you accidentally clip the player on the
      far East/West (marked "3"). It doesn't help that Omega in the center is
      blocking your view of that player.</p>
      <p>One of the advantages of Astoh's strat is that each monitor player can
      clearly see the <b>two</b> other players they are supposed to hit with
      their monitors (without Omega in the way). Tilting up/down a little gives
      you additional margin of error to not hit the player at "3"- you can tilt
      as much as you want, so long as you still hit the two people you're
      supposed to (who aren't blocked by Omega).</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Cascading Latent Defect/Latent Performance Defect]</b> Why did we wipe to
  this even though we took the towers correctly?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is the result of <em>Cascading Latent Defect</em> or <em>Latent
      Performance Defect</em> expiring without getting cleansed.</p>
      <p>This means that either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A red/blue tower was taken without the same-coloured Nisi
        <em>or</em></li>
        <li>The Nisi was taken too late in the previous round.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taking the towers gives players a 10-second <em>Cascading Latent 
      Defect</em> or <em>Latent Performance Defect</em> debuffs, which need to
      be cleaned by the appropriate Bug (the Nisis) debuffs by having them
      <b>expire before the Defects</b>.</p>
      <p>The timeline for each loop looks like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>T+0s:</b> Towers resolve.</li>
        <li><b>T+21s:</b> Next towers resolve and apply Defects.</li>
        <li><b>T+31s:</b> Defects resolve, wiping the raid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since the Nisi debuffs last 27 seconds and must expire before the
      Defects do, this means you have a 3-4 second window after towers resolve
      to pass Nisis (Note: <em>not</em> necessarily break tethers!) for the
      Nisis to expire in time to cleanse the next tower's Defects.</p>
      <p>If you miss this window, your Nisi will not expire in time to cleanse
      the Defects before they explode and wipe the raid.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> A <em>Critical Overflow</em> AoE went off
  during monitors! What happened?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Critical Error</em> has an additional effect besides just
      raid-wide damage- it gives <em>all</em> party members a
      <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> debuff.</p>
      <p>However, in normal cases, all party members would have the
      <em>Overflow Debugger</em> buff on them from resolving <em>Critical
      Error</em> previously. This buff is <em>lost</em> if the player dies.</p>
      <p>Thus, if a player that has already resolved their <em>Critical Overflow 
      Bug</em> dies and is raised, <em>Critical Error</em> will give them a 
      fresh copy of <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>, which just so happens to 
      resolve in 21 seconds, which is also when <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em> 
      resolves.</p>
