## Hello, World

Although *Hello, World* may look overwhelming at first, there are really just
two variations, determined by which colour debuff (*Critical Performance* and
*Critical Underflow*) get paired with *Critical Overflow* and *Critical
Synchronization*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/hello_world_0_0a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/hello_world_0_0b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Blue is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
      has Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Red is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After that, Hello, World is simply a cycle of debuffs to resolve. At any one
point, two players will be at each stage in the cycle.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The basic loop consists of:</p>

        (red Nisi) and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">
        (blue Nisi). Break Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/remote_regression.png">

          <ul>
            <li><em>If you just took a tower, you will swap sides/colours for
            the next iteration.</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/hello_world_cycle.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Players will alternate between towers and tethers each cycle.

This loop is repeated four times (so all players will have their go at each
debuff), although the final iteration has one small difference where the *Local
Regression* players stand away from the *Critical Overflows Bugs* instead.

### Fourth (final) iteration

All players rotate their roles again for the fourth (and final) iteration.

- Players who were Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
  become Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/remote_regression.png">
  (blue tethers)
- Players who were Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/remote_regression.png">
  become Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
- Players who were Critical Synchronization <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
  become Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/local_regression.png">
  (red/green tethers)
- Players who were Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/local_regression.png">
  become Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">.

This time around, there are two differences:

1. Red/green tethers will **join** the blue tethers at Critical
   Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
   instead of getting hit by Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
   and break **first**.
2. Players will **not** pass Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png">
   and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">.

Also note that because all players have gone through all the previous roles,
they have the *Underflow Debugger* and *Performance Debugger* buffs that 
prevent them from receiving *Critical Underflow Bug* and *Critical Performance 
Bug* again (the Nisis).

Thus, this final set of towers is **free movement**, as the Nisis will not be 
passed, even if players bump into one another.

## Oversampled Wave Cannon

Omega then brings back its "monitors" mechanic from O12S-2, with the added
twist that three random players *also* get their own set of monitors to
resolve.

With four monitors in total (Omega and three players) and each monitor hitting
two players, the party needs to arrange themselves such that all players will
take exactly one monitor hit each.

      <p>This is an extension of the mechanic "Oversampled Wave Cannon" from
      O12S-2.</p>
      <p>Monitors will appear on one side of Omega. When the mechanic resolves,
      two random players on the side with the monitors will be hit with an AoE. 
      If there are fewer than two players, then a random player (from anywhere) 
      is selected for each player missing instead.</p>
      <p>This phase extends the idea and adds monitors to players that work the
      same way- when the debuff resolves, two random players on the monitor
      side of the debuffed <em>player</em> will be selected for an AoE.</p>

PF currently resolves this using [Astoh's strat](https://twitter.com/Astoh_Shallfir/status/1619911321499361283)
(アスト式), but with a different lineup order.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Line up, north-to-south:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>North:</b> H1 H2 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 <b>:South</b></li>
      </ul>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>2.</b> Omega will ready Oversampled Wave Cannon (monitors), facing 
      directly east or west.</p>
      <p>Three random players will also get their own set of monitors.</p>
      <p>Resolve them as follows, with all three monitor players on the other
      side of Omega's monitors.</p>
      <p>The player positions are not particularly strict, so long as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Players are sufficiently spread so they do not clip one another.</li>
        <li>Each monitor hits the correct two players. Note that each player
        monitor should be able to see the two other players they need to hit.</li>

        <li>The monitor 2 and 3 players are angled slightly (instead of being
        horizontal).</li>
        <li>The non-monitor player marked 2 should be slightly off the center.</li>
        <li>The closer the non-monitor player marked 3 can be to the center,
        the lesser the chance they get accidentally clipped.</li>

      <p>Note that it is far easier for non-monitor players to adjust to the 
      monitor players as needed.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Local Regression]</b> Why do the Local Regression players not stand with
  the Critical Overflows in the final iteration?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Omega casts <em>Critical Error</em> at the end of Hello, World.</p>
      <p>This will apply a new <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> onto <em>all</em> 
      players. However, because all players have the <em>Critical Overflow 
      Debugger</em> buff, this additional <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> is 
      blocked.</p>
      <p>If the <em>Local Regression</em> players stayed with the <em>Critical 
      Overflow Bug</em> players in the final iteration, their <em>Critical 
      Overflow Debugger</em> buffs would get consumed there instead.</p>
      <p>As as result, they won't have the <em>Critical Overflow Debugger</em> 
      buff when Omega casts <em>Critical Error</em>, and will get another round 
      of <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>s that will last into <em>Oversampled 
      Wave Cannon</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Why are the healers north-most? Doesn't
  putting healers south-most guarantee the southern spot goes to a ranged?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Putting all four ranged players south <em>guarantees</em> that the
    southern player is a ranged, thus providing full melee uptime even in the
    scenario where all three monitor players are ranged, but the chances of
    this happening are 1/14.</p>
    <p>Putting healers at the north side means that both extremeties will have
    ranged players in the average case, which allows them to go all the way to
    the edge of the arena to give the other players more room for error, the
    north-most monitor player in particular.</p>
    <p>That being said, doing so means that a melee may have to disconnect from
    the boss in the worst case scenario, but this is an acceptable scenario
    given its likelihood.</p></td>
  </tr>

</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Are two of the monitor players supposed to
  be angled slightly up and down as shown in the diagram?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Astoh's original diagram had those players look exactly East/West
      horizontally, and that's still fine and a workable strat.</p>
      <p>However, the problem with going horizontally is that if you're off by
      a little bit, there's a chance you accidentally clip the player on the
      far East/West (marked "3"). It doesn't help that Omega in the center is
      blocking your view of that player.</p>
      <p>One of the advantages of Astoh's strat is that each monitor player can
      clearly see the <b>two</b> other players they are supposed to hit with
      their monitors (without Omega in the way). Tilting up/down a little gives
      you additional margin of error to not hit the player at "3"- you can tilt
      as much as you want, so long as you still hit the two people you're
      supposed to (who aren't blocked by Omega).</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Cascading Latent Defect/Latent Performance Defect]</b> Why did we wipe to
  this even though we took the towers correctly?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Someone picked up <em>Critical Performance Bug</em> (the blue Nisi) or 
      <em>Critical Underflow Bug</em> (the red Nisi) too late.</p>
      <p>Taking the towers gives players a 10-second <em>Cascading Latent 
      Defect</em> or <em>Latent Performance Defect</em> debuffs, and the Bug 
      debuffs <b>must expire before</b> the Defects do, or the raid wipes.</p>
      <p>If you passed/picked up the Bugs too late, they will not expire in
      time to cleanse the Defects before they explode and wipe the raid.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> A <em>Critical Overflow</em> AoE went off
  during monitors! What happened?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Critical Error</em> has an additional effect besides just
      raid-wide damage- it gives <em>all</em> party members a
      <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> debuff.</p>
      <p>However, in normal cases, all party members would have the
      <em>Overflow Debugger</em> buff on them from resolving <em>Critical
      Error</em> previously. This buff is <em>lost</em> if the player dies.</p>
      <p>Thus, if a player that has already resolved their <em>Critical Overflow 
      Bug</em> dies and is raised, <em>Critical Error</em> will give them a 
      fresh copy of <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>, which just so happens to 
      resolve in 21 seconds, which is also when <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em> 
      resolves.</p>
