# The Omega Protocol (Ultimate)

Elemental's TOP PF strat can be broken down as follows:

- [**(Beetle) Omega**](01_omega.en.md): HTDH priority, NW/SE Pantokrator
- [**Omega M/F**](02_omega_mf.en.md): 1234 (〇×▽□)-4231
- [**(Final) Omega**](03_omega_reconfigured.en.md): Astoh monitors
- [**Blue Screen**](04_blue_screen.en.md): TRHM, melee adjust
- **Run: Dynamis**
  - [**Delta**](05a_run_dynamis_delta.en.md): Awk
  - [**Sigma**](05b_run_dynamis_sigma.en.md): Waymark towers
  - [**Omega**](05c_run_dynamis_omega.en.md)
- [**Alpha Omega**](06_alpha_omega.en.md): Clock spread, Wave Cannon stack east

### BiS Notes

- The Omega Protocal is a current Ultimate, and is **not** outgeared yet.
    - BiS will be a mix of i630 gear, and i635 gear from The Lunar Subterrane.

Looking towards the future:

- The Omega Protocol will not be outgeared until **i760** gear is available.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **287**.

## Things to note

- Using automarkers to mark players for the transition to P3, and to mark player positions in Delta, Sigma, and Omega is considered the norm (*use at your own risk*).
