# Ultimate Raids

Ultimate raids on Elemental are unique because they are **not** PF'ed by Japanese players. As a result, the English community has largely dictated the strats in Elemental Ultimate PF.

### A note on Automarkers

Perhaps because of this, there are also marked cultural differences when it comes to Ultimate. Using third-party tools to automatically mark players ("automarkers", or "AM" for short) is considered the norm for some of these fights when it comes to PF.

As with all third-party tools, *use at your own risk.*
