  <li>The PF strat will usually take about 3 weeks to settle down, especially 
  further into the tier.</li>
  <li>The PF strat will be based on whatever Game8 publishes, which in turn
  will be based on the Japanese PF strat in Mana DC.</li>
  <li><em>Some parts</em> of the EN strat on Elemental may modify part(s) of
