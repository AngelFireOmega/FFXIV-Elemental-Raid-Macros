# AAC Light-heavyweight M1 (Savage)

The PF strat has not settled down yet. Join [the discord](https://discord.gg/WEzhVHwAU6)
to stay up to date with the discussion.

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/630292) has gone with Inumaru's strat for M1S as
a base, changing:

- The knockback/knockup *Elevate and Eviscerate* mechanic. Game8 is going with the 
  single-tile strat.
  - Each player has an assigned, *uncracked* tile (H1/D3 > MT/D1 > ST/D2 >
    H2/D4)
  - When marked, that player goes to their tile and positions themselves to get 
    knocked from one corner diagonally to the other corner of the the same
    tile, thus ignoring which stance the clone is actually in.
