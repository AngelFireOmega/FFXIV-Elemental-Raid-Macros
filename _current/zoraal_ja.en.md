## Markers

Markers aren't really needed for this fight- maybe one marker at North just to
demarcate where North is (as that's where the line-of-stacks begins).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Projection of Turmoil]</b> What was the "cheese strat", and what happened to it?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>On release, the debuffs that players got during <em>Projection of 
      Turmoil</em> would simply disappear if the timer expired without being
      triggered.</p>
      <p>This might seem okay because the "line-of-stacks" sweeps over the 
      arena, however, because the "death wall" in this instance is just a DoT,
      players discovered you could just step out <em>into</em> the death wall,
      avoiding the "line-of-stacks" altogether, and the debuffs would disappear
      without triggering anything.</p>
      <p>This was identified as an issue, and <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/6495aeb93d82245a8d7fe5aaee9e0d9f1121db0b">
      hotfixed about a week</a> after early access.</p>
      <p>Now, the stack triggers when the debuff's timer expires, invalidating 
      this method.</p>
