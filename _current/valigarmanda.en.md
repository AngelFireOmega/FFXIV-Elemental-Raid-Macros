# Worqor Lar Dor (Extreme)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION - the strats here have not yet settled, and can still 
change.</b>
</div>

**Note:** As an EX trial, this will eventually follow whatever Game8 decides on.

PF currently follows mostly Hamkatsu's guide, although note that it is **still 
early and modifications may still be made**.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Which feather the party will destroy in *Hail of Feathers*. English 
  guides have been destroying the **first** feather that falls (E or W). 
  **This is not done in JP**, where the party destroys the **second** feather
  that falls instead (SW or SE). *(I personally prefer JP's method.)*

## Japanese

```

Nukemaru has also made a guide for cross-referencing:

## Markers

There are currently **two** sets of markers going around.

### Nukemaru's markers

*(I personally prefer Nukemaru's markers for the time being)*

- The `1234` markers are the spots for the Fire pairs. They are **also** 
  inside the boss's donut AoE.
  - The `1` and `2` markers are also safe for the party during *Mountain Fire*.
- The `A` and `B` markers are the safe spots for dodging the Ice Stars in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice.

### Hamkatsu's markers

- The `1` and `2` markers are for the tanks during the Fire+Ice markers in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice.
- The `A` and `B` markers are the safe spots for dodging the Ice Stars in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice. Notably, they are **not** safe when dodging the boss's donut AoE.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Hail of Feathers]</b> Why do we destroy the second feather instead of the
  first?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Destroying the first feather maximises the time the party has before 
      <em>Blighted Bolt</em> resolves. However, the party has plenty of time 
      to destroy the second feather instead.</p>
      <p>More importantly, you <b>cannot stay and melee the boss</b> after
      destroying the first feather, as it is too close to the sixth (and final)
      feather.</p>
      <p>This is <em>not</em> the case for the second feather- players can 
      switch over to the boss without needing to pay attention to when the 
      later feathers will fall.</p>
