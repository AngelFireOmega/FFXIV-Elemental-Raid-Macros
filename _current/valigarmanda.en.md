# Worqor Lar Dor (Extreme)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION - the strats here have not yet settled, and can still 
change.</b>
</div>

**Note:** As an EX trial, this will eventually follow whatever Game8 decides on.

PF currently follows mostly Hamkatsu's guide, although note that it is **still 
early and modifications may still be made**.
