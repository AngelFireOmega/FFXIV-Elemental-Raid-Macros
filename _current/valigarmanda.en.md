# Worqor Lar Dor (Extreme)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION - the strats here have not yet settled, and can still 
change.</b>
</div>

**Note:** As an EX trial, this will eventually follow whatever Game8 decides on.

PF currently follows mostly Hamkatsu's guide, although note that it is **still 
early and modifications may still be made**.

Nukemaru has also made a guide for cross-referencing:

## Markers

There are currently **two** sets of markers going around.

### Nukemaru's markers

*(I personally prefer Nukemaru's markers for the time being)*

- The `1234` markers are the spots for the Fire pairs. They are **also** 
  inside the boss's donut AoE.
  - The `1` and `2` markers are also safe for the party during *Mountain Fire*.
- The `A` and `B` markers are the safe spots for dodging the Ice Stars in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice.

### Hamkatsu's markers

- The `1` and `2` markers are for the tanks during the Fire+Ice markers in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice.
- The `A` and `B` markers are the safe spots for dodging the Ice Stars in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice. Notably, they are **not** safe when dodging the boss's donut AoE.
