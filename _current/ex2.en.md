# Everkeep (Extreme)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b> As an EX trial, this will eventually follow whatever Game8 decides on.
</div>

PF currently follows Hamkatsu's guide:

### Things to check on Party Finder

- How the party will resolve [Projection of Turmoil](#projection-of-turmoil).
  - Note that the "cheese" strat will be patched out shortly.

## Markers

Markers aren't really needed for this fight- maybe one marker at North just to
demarcate where North is (as that's where the line-of-stacks begins).

## Projection of Turmoil

There are currently a couple different ways to resolve *Projection of Turmoil*.

1. The macros above follow Hamkatsu, and have the party resolve the mechanic 
   "properly" with a single 8-man stack each time.
2. Another strat involves just stepping outside the arena and waiting for the
   line to disappear. This is currently picking up in Mana (look for 外周無視 or 
   頭割り無視).
   - **Note:** [This has been identified as an issue, and will be addressed.](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/3b60d81a7123a4894e208f835c043c22eb4697b5)
