# Everkeep (Extreme)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION - the strats here have not yet settled, and can still 
change.</b>
</div>

**Note:** As an EX trial, this will eventually follow whatever Game8 decides on.

PF currently follows mostly Hamkatsu's guide, although note that it is still 
early and modifications may still be made.

## Projection of Turmoil

There are currently a couple different ways to resolve *Projection of Turmoil*.

1. The macros above follow Hamkatsu, and have the party resolve the mechanic 
   "properly" with a single 8-man stack each time.
2. Another strat involves just stepping outside the arena and waiting for the
   line to disappear. This is **not** commonly practiced in Mana (although it
   may pick up in Elemental).
