# The Voidcast Dais (Extreme)

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/529320) has gone ahead with Hamkatsu's strat for Golbez EX.

## Markers

Game8/Hamkatsu uses the following markers:

- `ABCD` are for orientation. 
- The `1` marker in the middle is for the healer knockback position.

I personally quite like these markers:

- `ABCD` are for orientation. 
- The `1234` markers demarcate the boundaries of the Gale Force line AoEs (markers are *not* safe), and players can stand on the markers to get knocked back to the towers.
