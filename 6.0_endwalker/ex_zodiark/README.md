# The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall

No macro needed for this fight! *(just dodge everything)*

## Markers

The `A` marker is placed so that it is the safe spot for Adikia + front row AoE.

All other markers are not really needed, but can be useful for calling out safe spots during the starstorm.
