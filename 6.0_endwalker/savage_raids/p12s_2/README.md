# Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle (Savage) - Part 2

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;"><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></div>

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/535668) has listed out a strat, but oddly has not published a macro (yet).

Meanwhile, Nukemaru has published a video outlining the PF strat:

{% include youtube.html id="5c3-Rinh6lA" %}
*(English subtitled)*

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the Caloric Theory 1 strat.
  - **Japanese** parties will go with [Mochibe's strat](#nukemaru--mochibes-caloric-1).
  - **English** parties will go with [Papan's strat](#nukemaru--papans-caloric-1).

## Nukemaru + Mochibe's Caloric 1

This is the preferred strat by JP.

### English (Mochibe)
