# Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle (Savage) - Part 2

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;"><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></div>

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/535668) has listed out a strat, but oddly has not published a macro (yet).

Meanwhile, Nukemaru has published a video outlining the PF strat:

```
{% include_relative macros/p12s_2.en.txt %}
```

### Japanese

```
