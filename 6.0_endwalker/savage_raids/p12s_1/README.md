## Superchain Theory 1

The debuffs applied during Superchain Theory 1 split the party into tanks/healers and DPS:

- One role is responsible for placing and resolving the aspected towers.
- The other role will spread for the Heavensflame AoEs.

Because of this, the movement after the third set of shapes is fixed:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tanks + Healers Heavensflame, DPS towers</th>
    <th>DPS Heavensflame, Tanks + Healers towers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/superchain_theory_01a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="images/superchain_theory_01b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Limit Cut

The diagram below showcases the general idea, but the positioning for baiting the beams is inconsistent.

When baiting the beams, **PF will put the smaller number on the right**, facing inwards (numbers increase as you go clockwise).
