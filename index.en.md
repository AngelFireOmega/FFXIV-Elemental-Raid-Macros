# FFXIV Elemental Raid Macros

This repository is a collection of macros (and my notes) often encountered in
the Elemental Data Center (DC).

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, these macros are for
**Japanese** PF strategies. Keep that in mind that when watching (English)
videos/reading guides- the strategies used may have some differences from the
ones here.

Of course, there will probably be small differences between the macros here and
the ones you may encounter in PF- use the ones here as a base to work with.

<ul>
  <li>The PF strat will usually take about 3 weeks to settle down, especially 
  as you go further into the tier.</li>
  <li>The PF strat will be based on whatever Game8 publishes, which in turn
  will be based on the Japanese PF strat in Mana DC.</li>
  <li><em>Some parts</em> of the EN strat on Elemental may modify part(s) of
  the Japanese PF strat.</li>
  <li>There are discussion channels on <a href="https://discord.gg/WEzhVHwAU6">the Discord</a> to help stay up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
